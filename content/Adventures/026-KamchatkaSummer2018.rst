he Kamchatka Peninsula is a little known region of the world. When I
was telling friends and acquaintances that I was going there, I was
often met with puzzled looks. Russia is certainly not high on the travel
agenda for many Australians, and far Eastern Russia must be a fair bit
lower, despite Kamchatka almost being in the same time zone as us.

"A land of ice and fire", during winter Kamchatka's weather consists
of very low temperatures, and a huge amount of snow. There are <insert
here> active volcanos on Kamchatka, two of these will be erupting on
any given day. From a geological perspective, the vast wilderness
areas of Kamchatka are full of interesting discoveries. Kamchatka is
also full of interesting wildlife which tends to be more active during
the summer months, the Kamchatka Brown Bear being the most noteable
furry resident in the region.

Ever since seeing a photograph of a skier descending one of the many
large and aesthetically pleasing volcanos in Kamchatka a couple of
years ago, I have been drawn to the concept of visiting this
location. When I arrived back from Japan, I was still on a high from
skiing the stratovolcano Yotei <insert link> with Sam. My mind
immediately turned to planning a trip to Kamchatka and I spent the
month online seeking out someone with knowledge about skiing in
Kamchatka who could help me with the understanding the logistics, this
is how I met Anna.

Summer and Winter in Kamchatka are extremely different, and it is said
to be very much worth visiting the place during all seasons. To see
Kamchatka both sprouting in green, to see the brief golden Autumn and
to see it cloaked in white are worthwhile experiences. With Anna
returning to her home in Kamchatka to see family and work as a hiking
guide this summer, it was the perfect opportunity for me to go with
her and scope the place out in Summer.

During the planning and the trip itself I have learned that if you are
planning an independent, unguided trip to Kamchatka as a foreigner to
this part of Russia, there are two major challenges to overcome: Visa
and Transport. If you are to join one of the guided, all expenses
covered tours these things are not a big issue, but if you wish to
explore Kamchatka with your own itinerary, on your own budget, at your
own pace and with your own sense of adventure, there are more
challenges to overcome. Many of these are alleviated by having a
friend or contact living in Kamchatka who knows how things work over
there. I had Anna to help me for this trip. During my trip research I
heard good things about Martha Madson <insert link to her website>, an
American expat living there.

The Journey There
-----------------

So, I jumped on a plane in Melbourne, spent some time in Hong Kong,
then arrived in Russia in the city of Vladivostok. In the airport I
was greeted by the sight of a fresh seafood store, something of a
novelty for me! The next flight was soon, and I rechecked my bag into
the domestic flight. As I was clearing security, a flight attendent
from Aeroflot approached me and handed me a business class ticket
saying I had been upgraded for free. On the plane I felt a little out
of place in my hiking clothes surrounded by Russian business people,
and a tired looking airline pilot doing his crossword in the seat next
to me. It was my first time travelling business class!

During the meals I forgot that I was sitting in a (comfortable)
airline seat and moved the seat forward spilling the drink and meal of
the passenger behind me. I looked back and apologised, he was a very
big and intimidating looking guy, possibly restrained by his partner,
saying something angry in Russian language. I faced forward again with
a red face and hoped it wouldn't make too much of a scene!

We got out of the plane parked on the tarmac at Yelisava??? and
stepped into the sunlight of a beautiful 25 degree blue sky summer's
day. The airport has many trees surrounding it, and the smell of
nature was immediately evident. The baggage collection at the time of
writing was in a tent style shelter near the terminal building. My bag
was almost the last bag to arrive, I was getting worried, but a pair
of boots going around on the conveyor belt provided some comic relief!
Once outside, Anna was standing alone waiting for me, and we caught
the bus together to Petropavalsk-Kamchatsky, I will not easily forget
that day, it was great to meet her in person after talking with her
about the trip and getting to know her so well beforehand.

(Горели??) Gorely Volcano
-------------------------

The first hike on our flexible agenda was a visit to Gorely
volcano. From what I could understand this was to consist mostly of
people from Kamchatka, they were joining together in an ad-hoc fashion
to form a trip to share the transport costs and cook food for dinner
together before driving home.

The concept of shared transport takes on a new meaning when hiking in
Kamchatka.
