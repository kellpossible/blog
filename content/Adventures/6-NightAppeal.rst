*y torch flickers, and then goes out. Halfway through the second pitch, I call out below something to make my belayer worried. Stopping to take stock, behind me are yells and hoots, a couch burning bonfire rages in the campsite. Lingshu is making funny noises around the corner on Agamemnon.  Waiting was worthwhile, the moon shines through and lights the route ahead.”* - 30th June 2015

*“It’s dark, so backing off from a climb, let’s go exploring for another way up the Horn instead. We found a cave which lead to nowhere, that was fun. We then find ourselves a bit lost and bush bashing. Finally someone at the carpark hears us!”* - Mid 2015

*“Stepping away from my partner and out over the void. I've been here during the day, I know what it looks like down below, but in the darkness the imagination can have free reign.”* - 20th of June 2016

*“Excited to have made it to the top. With the air clear between us, Mt Buller floats like a sky city between the clouds.”* - 8th of July 2016

*“We sit perched at the top of the tower as the light fades and waves crash below. It’s getting cold, but I would happily sit here all night”*- 29 of October 2016

To me, the night is exciting and irresistibly appealing. As a club we pay tribute to it every year with the midnight ascent. With sight diminished, I find myself responding strongly to my partner, and the other senses; the experience becomes surreal and memorable. I do struggle with balancing the desire to prance under the starlight with the voice of reason, comfort and safety. Romantic notions often get the better.
