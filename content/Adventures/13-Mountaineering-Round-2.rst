follow up mountaineering trip to New Zealand, given the success of the
previous season, was always going to be on the cards. Five of us flew
over near the new year for 2016, for a couple of weeks climbing up at
Pioneer hut. I was excited about this trip for the entire year, and it
was a possibility that we may make an attempt on Mt Tasman, something
that, if the conditions were favourable, should be within our ability.

Flying in to Pioneer, we looked down and saw the remains of a snowman, and a Happy New Year
MUMC sign. These were still visible messages from our friends who had spent the
previous two weeks climbing and mucking about. The logbook was a bit
of a mystery, filled with what was evidently a clash of emotions and
personalities. After an afternoon jaunt on the pink cliffs above the
hut, Jules found the accordion and we were in for a lazy evening of
banter.

After a push up the west ridge of Haidinger, the conditions could
aptly be referred to as a slop fest, we were all hanging out for a
decent freeze so we could go and climb some mountains. Jules and I
made it back to the hut early one afternoon. As the clouds closed in,
We decided he should play the accordion on the balcony to guide the
others to us.

A fresh load of helicopters crammed the hut full of climbers, and we
no longer had the peaceful place to ourselves. An Italian guide and
his obnoxious Kiwi client dominated the conversation, the latter
declaring that he was a very loud snorer, and there was nothing we
could do about it! It was not long before we learned from a young
guide that there had been an accident over on the other side of the
range. A couple had fallen off the Silberhorn just after Christmas,
and their bodies recovered and identified as none other than our good
friends Dale and Stu.

I decided not to climb out of respect for my family who undoubtedly
would have heard the news before us and be worrying about me. Several
days were spent contemplating what this meant. In the background the
loud and annoying Kiwi fellow hadn't the empathy to notice that some
of his comments struck a little too close to home.

A few days later, three of us left early, the desire to be in the
mountains squashed by the disaster.

Like good friends do, we stuck together and made the most of our
holiday, going on several tramps to some of the most beautiful places
I have ever had the pleasure to be in. The Hollyford track gets a
solid five stars in my book!
