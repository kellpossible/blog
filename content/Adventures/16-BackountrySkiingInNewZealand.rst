he aim was simple: do an avalanche course, and practice what we
learned. This was to be my first trip to New Zealand in winter, and
as such I didn't really know what to expect in terms of weather or
snow conditions. For the previous 6 months I had been working away
organising a group of friends to participate in an avalanche
course. We didn't want something too expensive/all expenses covered,
but rather were keen just to learn as much as we could so we would be
enabled to make our own informed choices in the backcountry.

I had a look around at various courses, and found the best candidate
visible online was the `4 day Aspiring Guides Backcountry Avalanche Course
<http://www.aspiringguides.com/aspiring-guides/ski/courses/backcountry-avalanche-course-msc.aspx>`_.
I thought back to when I did my TMC with a guide and remembered how
valuable it was to be able to talk with them about the trip and what
we wanted to get out of it. So I did a bit of searching for smaller
guiding companies who run avalanche courses, and `Anna Keeling's <http://www.annakeelingguiding.co.nz/>`_ name
hit the top of the list pretty quickly. I'd recognised her name from
some outdoors articles I'd read, especially those in the NZAC
publications. We exchanged some emails, and it was evident that doing
a course with her would be a good idea because we could focus on
exactly what we wanted to learn, she would have a good idea about our
abilities, and the course could be catered for us. The best part was
that it was probably going to cost less than any of the other
backcountry avalanche courses considering there were 8 of us
interested in participating.

New Skis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is rather dry, and more stands for a reference for those

TODO: move this section to its own article.

In the lead up to the trip, I decided to buy a new pair of skis.
My current pair was a Fischer S-Bound 98 ski. Interestingly, Fischer have
enguaged in some misleading marketing, the sidecut of these skis is really
69mm under foot, and the 98 is the maximum sidecut. Whereas, the common
way to refer to a ski width appears to be the sidecut under foot.
This ski has a pattern base, and is ideal for ski touring in most
Australian snow conditions, especially rolling hills. Unfortunately
research suggested that the ski width would be far from adequate
in New Zealand conditions. Something closer to 90mm would be ideal.

On top of the width problem, I also have the skis mounted with 7TM Tour
Telemark bindings. I'm not the most confident tele skier, and often find
myself resorting to parallel turns when the going gets tough, especially
when wearing a heavy backpack. New Zealand terrain is usually steeper and
more serious, and with this in mind, it seemed sensible to get some Alpine 
Touring bindings and boots to accompany the new skis. Further research
into the issue revealed that dynafit Alpine Touring setups are usually
considerably lighter. 

Initially I had a look around locally for the setup I was after. Starting
with the boots. The Dynafit TLT4 boots are touted as being good for both
skiing and ice climbing in crampons, so I wanted to try and find a pair
at least similar to those. First point of call was `Bogong <http://www.bogong.com.au/>`_ in Little
Bourke Street, Melbourne. I noticed that many of their boots on display
were fairly old models, and sizing options were limited, 
but had some great discounts. Trying a few on,
I couldn't find a pair that seemed exactly what I was after, but the
Bogong staff member suggested that I could buy and take a pair home
to walk around in, and return a week later if they didn't work out.

So that's what I did. The boots turned out not to be the best fit,
and rather heavy to walk in, so they got returned. Next was a visit
to `Bumps <https://bumps.com.au/>`_. They had a great range of boots
and sizes. The prices were staggering, and chatting to the staff,
it appeared the low turnover rate of this stock brought about the higher
prices. The also are the only store in Melbourne that 
stocks the newer model boots. Suffice to say, I didn't try any boots on,
and went back to square one.

Several recommendations online seemed to suggest that ordering from
https://www.telemark-pyrenees.com/ could be a good option. They have a 
good reputation, ship to Australia, and their range of boots, skis and bindings
is far better than any other store I've seen. The prices were also better,
almost half the price as buying here in Australia, shipping included.
So I decided to risk it, purchased some boots, skis, bindings and skins
from the store, along with an avalanche beacon and probe.

They all arrived unexpectedly quickly. Opening the box, out popped the
Dynastar Cham 98 2.0 skis, with Dynafit TLT Radical ST 2.0 bindings and
the bright green Dynafit Winter Guide boots. The first thing I noticed,
with surprise, was that the new skis, were lighter than my telemark setup.
The Fischer skis are very light, but the hunk of metal that is the 7TM 
binding pretty much weighs more than the entire ski!

Being only the second pair of skis that I have owned, or used for a
significant amount of time, I don't really feel qualified to pass
judgement in a comprehensive review. The bindings had no failures,
and only got iced up on one occasion. The skis themselves were
comfortable in every snow condition we encountered (ice, powder,
hard packed powder, etc). The boots, one of the rivets that holds
the power strap in place popped out because I was walking around without
it done up and it got caught on something.

Arrival
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday we all departed from Melbourne on a red-eye flight to arrive
out at Christchurch international about 5am the next morning.

**TODO: Insert Photo Of Us At Airport Here**

Sam, Julian and myself were to be borrowing a friend's car which he
keeps on another friend's parent's property in Christchurch. The Dad,
who works at Christchurch airport very kindly offered to bring the car
to meet us in the morning, which was the same time when he started his
shift! So there it was sitting in the carpark at the airport. *"I've
had a little trouble starting the engine this morning, I think the
battery is a bit flat*" he said, an omen for interesting times to
come!

After a quick round up of shopping and visiting the outdoor stores,
we were on the way to Athurs pass. For quite a while I had had my eye
on the opening day at Temple Basin, and had convinced everyone that we
should book in Athurs pass at the NZAC accomodation in hope that they
may be open that weekend. But alas, without enough snow, Porters with
their snow makers was the only field in the area likely bo be open, so
we pulled in to Athur's pass feeling relaxed on a Saturday evening,
and checked out one of the waterfalls nearby.

Avalanche Course
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a day at Porters, cruising the slope they had open, and a couple
of relaxing nights in Athurs pass, we had made the discovery that our
car was in dire need of a new battery. Every time we stopped, we were
scoping out a hill to park on to push start, joking that we might have
to do this the whole trip!

And so it was, that we parked the car on a slight incline out the
front of the comunity centre in Castle Hill village, and headed inside
for the first day of the avalanche course.

Anna Keeling was overseas, due back the next day, so we had Kem and Al
as our guides and teachers for the first day. The morning started
with a brief introduction, then straight out into the field. The
weather was due to close in, and it was looking unlikely that we would
be able to get out the next day.

So we drove to the nearby ski field of Mt Cheeseman. Al had procured a
key to the gate to allow us access, as the field had not yet opened
for the season. Driving up the track, I couldn't help but admire the
feeling that dark green trees on either side gives as the morning sun
shines through. It' s a very pretty part of New Zealand. Clearing the
tree line, there was one very steep section where we had to get out
and push.

Luckily, we didn't have to walk far to get to the snow, the cat track
had snow all the way to the carpark, despite the surrounding slopes
being completely bare.

As we got higher and onto the steeper slopes, Al outlined the
importance of seperation for safe travel while on avalanche terrain in
the backcountry, we kept a gap of 15-20m between us any time we were
on a slope steep enough to slide.

Reaching the top, it was amazing to see that the North facing slopes
had no snow at all! A quick lunch, and we made our way down the ridge
to a saddle. I was second last, and looking back I noticed Shree one
of our group members, a little hesitant, then, he plunged straight
down the ridge towards me, performing what my friend Dale would refer
to as "the snow plow of doom". Luckily for us, he pulled it off, and
stopped next to the group, as though nothing had happened. I was
probably one of the only ones to notice and I'm not sure yet what to
make of that performace!

Anyhow, next was the proper down hill. Al informed us that the slope
we were about to descend was 28 degrees at a maximum. Unlikely to
slide in most conditions. Someone was positioned to the side halfway
down the slope in order that we may have eyes on everybody all the
time to be able to respond quickly should there be any accident.

We stopped halfway down the slope to dig snow pits, and observe the
snow. Layers of facets on the surface and near the ground were
obvious. 10cm of snow on the surface easily slid on one of these beds
of facets. Not enough snow to be too worried now, but enough to be
concerned for the next snowfall which would introduce a large load on
top.
