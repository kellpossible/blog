he aim was simple: do an avalanche course, and practice what we
learned. This was to be my first trip to New Zealand in winter, and
as such I didn't really know what to expect in terms of weather or
snow conditions. For the previous 6 months I had been working away
organising a group of friends to participate in an avalanche
course. We didn't want something too expensive/all expenses covered,
but rather were keen just to learn as much as we could so we would be
enabled to make our own informed choices in the backcountry.

I had a look around at various courses, and found the best candidate
visible online was the `4 day Aspiring Guides Backcountry Avalanche Course
<http://www.aspiringguides.com/aspiring-guides/ski/courses/backcountry-avalanche-course-msc.aspx>`_.
I thought back to when I did my TMC with a guide and remembered how
valuable it was to be able to talk with them about the trip and what
we wanted to get out of it. So I did a bit of searching for smaller
guiding companies who run avalanche courses, and `Anna Keeling's <http://www.annakeelingguiding.co.nz/>`_ name
hit the top of the list pretty quickly. I'd recognised her name from
some outdoors articles I'd read, especially those in the NZAC
publications. We exchanged some emails, and it was evident that doing
a course with her would be a good idea because we could focus on
exactly what we wanted to learn, she would have a good idea about our
abilities, and the course could be catered for us. The best part was
that it was probably going to cost less than any of the other
backcountry avalanche courses considering there were 8 of us
interested in participating.

Arrival
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday we all departed from Melbourne on a red-eye flight to arrive
out at Christchurch international about 5am the next morning.

**TODO: Insert Photo Of Us At Airport Here**

Sam, Julian and myself were to be borrowing a friend's car which he
keeps on another friend's parent's property in Christchurch. The Dad,
who works at Christchurch airport very kindly offered to bring the car
to meet us in the morning, which was the same time when he started his
shift! So there it was sitting in the carpark at the airport. *"I've
had a little trouble starting the engine this morning, I think the
battery is a bit flat*" he said, an omen for interesting times to
come!

After a quick round up of shopping and visiting the outdoor stores,
we were on the way to Athurs pass. For quite a while I had had my eye
on the opening day at Temple Basin, and had convinced everyone that we
should book in Athurs pass at the NZAC accomodation in hope that they
may be open that weekend. But alas, without enough snow, Porters with
their snow makers was the only field in the area likely bo be open, so
we pulled in to Athur's pass feeling relaxed on a Saturday evening,
and checked out one of the waterfalls nearby.

Avalanche Course
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a day at Porters, cruising the slope they had open, and a couple
of relaxing nights in Athurs pass, we had made the discovery that our
car was in dire need of a new battery. Every time we stopped, we were
scoping out a hill to park on to push start, joking that we might have
to do this the whole trip!

And so it was, that we parked the car on a slight incline out the
front of the comunity centre in Castle Hill village, and headed inside
for the first day of the avalanche course.

Anna Keeling was overseas, due back the next day, so we had Kem and Al
as our guides and teachers for the first day. The morning started
with a brief introduction, then straight out into the field. The
weather was due to close in, and it was looking unlikely that we would
be able to get out the next day.

So we drove to the nearby ski field of Mt Cheeseman. Al had procured a
key to the gate to allow us access, as the field had not yet opened
for the season. Driving up the track, I couldn't help but admire the
feeling that dark green trees on either side gives as the morning sun
shines through. It' s a very pretty part of New Zealand. Clearing the
tree line, there was one very steep section where we had to get out
and push.

Luckily, we didn't have to walk far to get to the snow, the cat track
had snow all the way to the carpark, despite the surrounding slopes
being completely bare.

As we got higher and onto the steeper slopes, Al outlined the
importance of seperation for safe travel while on avalanche terrain in
the backcountry, we kept a gap of 15-20m between us any time we were
on a slope steep enough to slide.

Reaching the top, it was amazing to see that the North facing slopes
had no snow at all! A quick lunch, and we made our way down the ridge
to a saddle. I was second last, and looking back I noticed Shree one
of our group members, a little hesitant, then, he plunged straight
down the ridge towards me, performing what my friend Dale would refer
to as "the snow plow of doom". Luckily for us, he pulled it off, and
stopped next to the group, as though nothing had happened. I was
probably one of the only ones to notice and I'm not sure yet what to
make of that performace!

Anyhow, next was the proper down hill. Al informed us that the slope
we were about to descend was 28 degrees at a maximum. Unlikely to
slide in most conditions. Someone was positioned to the side halfway
down the slope in order that we may have eyes on everybody all the
time to be able to respond quickly should there be any accident.

We stopped halfway down the slope to dig snow pits, and observe the
snow. Layers of facets on the surface and near the ground were
obvious. 10cm of snow on the surface easily slid on one of these beds
of facets. Not enough snow to be too worried now, but enough to be
concerned for the next snowfall which would introduce a large load on
top.
