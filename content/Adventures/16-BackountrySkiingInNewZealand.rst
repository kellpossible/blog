he aim was simple: do an avalanche course, and practice what we
learned. This was to be my first trip to New Zealand in winter, and
as such I didn't really know what to expect in terms of weather or
snow conditions. For the previous 6 months I had been working away
organising a group of friends to participate in an avalanche
course. We didn't want something too expensive/all expenses covered,
but rather were keen just to learn as much as we could so we would be
enabled to make our own informed choices in the backcountry.

I had a look around at various courses, and found the best candidate
visible online was the `4 day Aspiring Guides Backcountry Avalanche Course
<http://www.aspiringguides.com/aspiring-guides/ski/courses/backcountry-avalanche-course-msc.aspx>`_.
I thought back to when I did my TMC with a guide and remembered how
valuable it was to be able to talk with them about the trip and what
we wanted to get out of it. So I did a bit of searching for smaller
guiding companies who run avalanche courses, and Anna Keeling's name
hit the top of the list pretty quickly. I'd recognised her name from
some outdoors articles I'd read, especially those in the NZAC
publications. We exchanged some emails, and it was evident that doing
a course with her would be a good idea because we could focus on
exactly what we wanted to learn, she would have a good idea about our
abilities, and the course could be catered for us. The best part was
that it was probably going to cost less than any of the other
backcountry avalanche courses considering there were 8 of us
interested in participating.
