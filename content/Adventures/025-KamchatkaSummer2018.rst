he Kamchatka Peninsula is a little known region of the world. When I
was telling friends and acquaintances that I was going there, I was
often met with puzzled looks. Russia is certainly not high on the travel
agenda for many Australians, and far Eastern Russia must be a fair bit
lower, despite Kamchatka almost being in the same time zone.

"A land of ice and fire", during winter Kamchatka receives very low
temperatures, and a huge amount of snow. There are <insert here>
active volcanos on Kamchatka, two of these will be erupting on any
given day. From a geological perspective, the vast wilderness areas of
Kamchatka are full of interesting discoveries. Kamchatka is also full
of interesting wildlife which tends to be more active during the
summer months, the Kamchatka Brown Bear being the most notable
furry resident in the region.

Ever since seeing a photograph of a skier descending one of the many
large and aesthetically pleasing volcanos in Kamchatka a couple of
years ago, I have been drawn to the concept of visiting this
location. When I arrived back from Japan, I was still on a high from
skiing the stratovolcano Yotei <insert link> with Sam. My mind
immediately turned to planning a trip to Kamchatka and I spent the
month online seeking out someone with knowledge about skiing in
Kamchatka who could help me with the understanding the logistics, this
is how I met Anna.

Through Anna I learned that Summer/Autumn and Winter/Spring in
Kamchatka are extremely different, and it's worth visiting the place
during both times, to see Kamchatka both sprouting in green, and to
see it cloaked in white are worthwhile experiences. With Anna
returning to her home in Kamchatka to see family and work as a hiking
guide this summer, it was the perfect opportunity for me to go with
her and scope the place out in Summer.

During the planning and the trip itself I have learned that if you are
planning an independent, unguided trip to Kamchatka as a foreigner to
Russia, there are two major challenges to overcome: Visa and
Transport. If you are to join one of the guided, all expenses covered
tours these things are not a big issue, but if you wish to explore
Kamchatka with your own itinerary, on your own budget, at your own
pace and with your own sense of adventure, there are many challenges
to overcome. Many of these are alleviated by having a friend or
contact living in Kamchatka.

In the months leading up to the trip I prepared my visa application,
and attempted to learn some of the Russian language.
