bsolutely no regrets choosing to do a mountaineering course before heading into the hills independently.
The course run in 2014 by Stuart Hollaway for MUMC members was a once in a lifetime, unforgetable opportunity.
It is so very sad to have to say that there will probably never be another quite like it. Stu and Dale passed away
in an accident while climbing the Silberhorn together the following year. They were both mentors and friends
to many of the club members. Despite their warnings, I don't think many of us really expected them,
the strongest, and boldest of us, to fall. 

I've wanted to write an account of the course for a long time now, but I've been busy, and didn't really
feel like I could touch the subject given the circumstances. I hope that others who read this can get
a little piece of Stu, second hand, and that there will be an opportunity to remember these lessons
and teach them to others. 

Their fate serves as a real reminder that despite knowing and following
the best techniques, up there all it takes is a single unfortunate event to ruin
your day. In my opinion, human fallibility is an objective risk which is perhaps the hardest to manage. 
We all make mistakes, the best might do it at a lower rate, but they still make mistakes. 
It is nice that in climbing it often takes a number of mistakes or chances to coincide to result in an accident, but when mountaineering the margin for error is often smaller. Pushing yourself to your physical limit
on a climb also increases your chance of making mental errors. 

Personally I aim to always stay well within my physical comfort zone, with plenty in reserve to try and reduce this risk and deal
with unexpected circumstances. This management pricipal I try to apply both while picking climbs, and while on route as
my understanding of the objective improves. If I want to climb something bigger or harder, I need to train and prepare more such that it is within this comfort level, or I don't go. 

Another philosophy I try to apply which ties in with this is to climb for the enjoyment and not the summit. If I climb
well within what I am physically comfortable, it will be much more enjoyable. I try to remove any emotional attachment
to the concept of reaching the top because this clouds sensible judgement about when to turn back. My reason for climbing
is the enjoyment of being in that environment, and the sensation of climbing. If we're having a good day and the conditions are perfect, we'll make the top by matter of course. As Ed Viesturs says, *"Getting to the top is optional. Getting down is mandatory."*.

I've more or less adhered to this principal the last two seasons of climbing, and despite what people
say about mountaineering being about suffering, it was actually quite enjoyable and I never felt
tired, or physically depleted. Sure there were moments of uncertainty, but these are much easier
to deal with when you're not tired.

Our course actually began in Melbourne. All the participants were from MUMC and knew Stu in some capacity
through the club. We met up on an evening in the clubrooms to discuss the course, some theory, the risks 
invovled, and to practice some roping up technique.

Pre-Alpine Weekend
------------------

Later in the year, around November, Stu organised the now annual pre-alpine skills weekend.
Here we ran through a number of key skills needed in the mountains that are easy to practice
at a location like Mt Arapiles. While climbing the key focus was completing long, easy routes
in a fast and efficient manner. Stu explained the reason for this: getting up quickly, and back
down quickly reduces your exposure to objective risks such as rockfall, icefall and soft snow
avalanches/slips. Don't follow rules religiously but consider every option carefully and always
be aware and prepared to make good compromises when the situation requires. The mountain doesn't
play by your rules.

Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~

One of the major gains in efficiency is to ensure that both you and your partner are always doing
something, nobody is sitting around waiting. If one person is coiling the rope, the other is
sorting out the rack, or chomping on a musli bar. 

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An important topic was safe and efficient comunication between climbers. Often the "On belay, climb when ready. Climbing. 
Climb on. Safe. On Belay, climb when ready. etc" can be reduced to a simpler "On belay" at the bottom, 
and "Safe" at the top. The rest can be inferred by watching your partner and the rope, as well as
an agreed plan of action. It isn't perfect, but practicing climbing like this with your partner
will allow you to deal with situations in high wind, and when you can't see or hear your partner.

Seconding
*********

If you're seconding there is a simple rule to follow, climb at the rate that your partner pulls the rope
up. Going faster puts a shock load on the anchor or your partner when you fall, and it can get tangled
up in your crampons.

If the rope comes tight on you and you've heard a muffled yell from above, you can make the assumption that 
either: 

+ Your partner has yelled on belay and you're good to start climbing.
+ They have reached the end of the rope.

Take the assumption that they have reached the end of the rope, if you take out your anchor, at worst
you are now simul-climbing, with many pieces of protection between you and your partner.

Take the assumption that they have yelled on belay, at worst they have yelled safe, are near the end of
their rope, and are just about to put you on belay.

Leading
*******

If you're leading there's another rule to follow, when reaching an anchor, pull rope up tight and chuck
your partner on belay as quickly as possible. There is a slight moment between when you've pulled up 
all the slack rope and when you put them on belay where your partner may have disconnected from the anchor
down below. Be aware of this and consider putting them on belay sooner if the situation requires.


Gear Placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ While climbing easy routes, the best option is just not to fall. Place the minimum gear required to prevent death, and allow you to move quickly and efficiently.
+ Focus your placements on protecting the crux sections of the route. 
+ What gear you'll need exactly will depend on the route. Often nuts can be reduced  because they can be rotated sideways to fit a greater range.
+ You should not be roped up together on technical terrain if there is not enough protection attached to the rope between you.
+ Try to avoid being roped up on high consequence terrain without protection even if it's easy. If you're going too slow, go unroped, or go back. The exception to this is short-roping, a guiding technique.
+ It can be acceptable to continue roped up without protection over "Granny Terrain" in order to reduce the number of transitions required.

Simul-climbing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simul-climbing is the act of both climbers climbing simultaneously.
If the seconder falls while the leader is climbing they will pull the
leader down off the mountain. For this reason it can be better
for the stronger climber to be second.

The leader is belayed until several pieces have been placed and the
rope comes tight on the seconder. The seconder then begins to climb,
without even bothering to take the belay device off usually, as it can
be used immediately to begin belaying again at a transition.

The length of rope between the climbers will depend on the situation
and the protection available. Long snow slopes with the occasional snow
stake you might use the full length of the rope. Slightly more technical
rock pitches you might go a bit shorter so that there are around three
or four pieces of protection between you.

When the leader runs out of gear they build an anchor and immediately
belay their seconder up to them to collect the gear and start again.

Simul-climbing is reserved for less technical terrain where both the leader and the
seconder are very confident that they won't be falling off of their
own accord, as falling can incur a greater likelyhood of injury than
typical pitched climbing.

A technique for traversing easy ridge lines is take in coils, and travel together
with the strong climber behind, if someone falls off to one side,
the other person jumps over the other, and the rope catches them in the middle.


Anchors
~~~~~~~

The way Stu taught building anchors on the course was different to how I had initially learned, and the norm
for Victorian climbing. Instead of religiously placing three pieces of protection and equalising, he taught us
to consider the value of each piece that we use. If it's completely bomber (*Bomproof*, totally secure) 
then it is possible to be content with a single piece. 

Probably bomber:

+ A sling securely around a large, obviously well connected horn of rock.
+ A snow stake that took a good 15 or so hits with the hammer to slide in.

Probably Less bomber:

+ a single cam in a good crack.
+ a single ice screw.
+ a single nut.

The the total "bomber" value required for your anchor will depend on the situation.
When scrambling up an easy slope, a body belay behind a large block, or from within
a crevasse/shrund might be considered sufficient without any extra protection.

A special focus was on sling anchors, and the need to weight the anchor to keep it sitting on
the rock in the correct position and stop it slipping off.

Another type of anchor was to just wrap the rope around the back of a chicken head or bollard,
and pull the person up and over hand. The friction of the rock was enough to hold
a person's fall on easy ground.


Abseiling
~~~~~~~~~

In the mountains it is common to find long descents with many abseils. Getting 
more efficient at abseiling can greatly reduce the time it takes to descend
off a climb, which may be rapidly deteriorating in the afternoon sun.

You need to figure out and practice a system with your partner which is as
efficient as possible. You need to be confident doing this even when you're
tired at the end of the day. Run through a checklist in your head at every point. 
A large proportion of climbing accidents occur on the descent.


Lowering
********

In many situations lowering down may be a better option than abseiling.

+ If it's windy and you want to direct where the rope goes accurately.
+ If you want to downclimb afterwards, the first person can place protection for the second person on the way down.
+ Less likely to let go of the rope or need a prusik

Prusiks
*******

Stu often didn't use prusiks but I do remember him saying he felt like he 
should probably try and use them more often. I can't remember exactly what
he said on the topic, so much of this is my own words/logic, probably
heavily influenced by what he has said on the topic.

Prusiks can make you a lot slower on the abseil and have the potential to jam up. 
While descending down a clean wall or snow slope, you will go a lot faster without a prusik. In the
extremely unlikely chance that you let go of the rope in this scenario, 
you'll go for a slide and hit the knots on the end of your rope and be fine (if you're anchor's bomber).

For the person coming down second, a fireman's belay is a much better option than a prusik,
it costs no time, no speed, and offers a similar level of safety without the fuss. I always
ask for a firemans belay when coming down second while cragging.

I personally use a prusik when:

+ I'm feeling a bit tired
+ I'm covering unknown or uncertain ground
+ I'm descending through loose rock which may hit me
  
Direction
*********

The direction you take while abseiling can be important. If you have abseiled straight down the
fall line, then your partner may drop ice or rocks on top of you at the next anchor. When you
go to pull the rope down, it may also dislodge rocks to fall on you. Try to avoid this.

Anchor Backup and Test Loading
******************************

A habit/routine that Stu promoted was that of test loading your abseil setup
while still clipped into your safety. This way you can visually and physically
confirm that you are ready to go before detaching your safety from the anchor.

If you are intending to abseil off a single piece, it is good practice to
back up this piece with another piece which is attached such that it doesn't
take any load unless the first piece fails. The first, and preferably heavier 
person descends with both pieces in place while the second person closely
inspects the piece taking the load. If they are happy with it, they
can remove the back up piece and leave only the single piece anchor
behind. 


Routine
*******

An example routine for a multi-pitch abseil down a steep neve slope:

1. Build your anchor and clip in.
2. Thread the rope through and throw it down. Second person helps coiling and throwing.
3. First person attaches and test loads their system.
4. First person descends. Second person watches anchor and gets ready to attach.
5. First person nears the end of rope and creates suitable anchor.
6. First person attaches to anchor, takes themselves off the rope and yells "off rope"
7. Second person attaches and test loads their system. First person holds rope in one hand, and in the other hand/mouth undoes knots in end of rope and begins threading through the next anchor.
8. Second person descends, while the first person gives them a fireman's belay.
9. Second person reaches anchor, clips in and takes themselves off the rope.
10. Second person pulls rope down, first person threads rope through anchor, coils and throws.
11. Repeat until you reach the bottom.
    
Someone is always doing something, there is no waiting around.


Balance and Facing In
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staying in balance and in a secure stance at all times, especially when unroped, is crucial while mountaineering.
While I was setting up my anchor at the top of the cliff, Stu made the comment that I was not in a secure posiiton.
I had been standing upright, flat on my feet. All it would have taken for me to fall off backwards would have been a big
gust of wind. Easy to fix by just leaning forward against the rock. This is perhaps even more important while doing tasks
like setting up an anchor, where your attention is not on your balance, but on the task at hand. *"Stay strong in the mountain"*
was a takeaway catchphrase for all of us from the course. I'm pretty sure Stu yelled that phrase at all of us
at some stage.
