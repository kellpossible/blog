bsolutely no regrets choosing to do a mountaineering course before heading into the hills independently.
The course run in 2014 by Stuart Hollaway for MUMC members was a once in a lifetime, unforgetable opportunity.
It is so very sad to have to say that there will probably never be another quite like it. Stu and Dale passed away
in an accident while climbing the Silberhorn together the following year. They were both mentors and friends
to many of the club members. Despite their warnings, I don't think many of us really expected them,
the strongest, and boldest of us, to fall. 

I found out while climbing on the opposite side of the range, in Pioneer Hut. A guide arrived that morning
with some clients, and brought the news. The next couple of days were spent lying awake in bed, confused about
what had happened, wondering how worried my family back home were about me, as many of them had met both
Dale and Stu. A couple of the others went out for some climbing, but the mood was considerably
dampened, so we arranged an early chopper flight out.

When I arrived back in Melbourne, the funeral had been missed. I spent many weeks opening up the news articles
forcing myself to recognise that what had happened was real. Contemplating the shock surrounding this event over 
the past year has led to many realisations about the mountains on my part. 

A philsophy I once heard, but never really appreciated until this year, was the concept that when mountaineering,
every time you climb you take a scoop out of your luck bucket and place it in the experience bucket. Your
experience can help you to climb safer, or harder objectives, but eventually your luck will run out if you
keep taking scoops. On top of this, none of us really know how big our luck bucket is.

The gut reaction to what happened is that mountaineering is not worth the risk and the pain that it causes
to loved ones. Even now as the pain fades, the memory makes it hard to justify putting my friends and family
through the same process again.

About three months later, I was nearly involved in a serious car accident. Reminded of my own
mortality, I considered how much I prefered having rocks fly past in the mountains 
to cars on the highway.
