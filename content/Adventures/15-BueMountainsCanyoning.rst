his Easter, I made the long car drive journey up to New South Whales
to join in the annual pilgrimage to go canyoning in the Blue
Mountains. With four drivers in the car, driving for 10 hours wasn't
seeming like such a horrible prospect. Along the way we stopped just
outside of canberra at one of the rest stops to join our friends in
the car ahead. There was tea and a fire in a can being hosted by some
kind volunteers who were there over Easter to promote driver safety,
they were really nice, and we decided to just get out our mats and
sleep under the picnic shelter.

The drive continued in the morning, but after a stop to admire a
sheep's behind, we managed to go an hour off course towards Sydney!
After turning back, the journey resumed, and we wound our way through
gradually smaller roads, until hitting the dirt shortly before
reaching Kanangra Boyd National Park.

Dione Dell
-----------

After grabbing a bite to eat for lunch, we headed down into Dione
Dell. The decision to make our Blue Mountains Canyoning debut in this
location was based on the notion that this canyon offered numerous
chances to escape, should our intentions of working together
effectively and efficiently as a group begin to falter, as we had
never all been canyoning together.

The afternoon passed quickly, and I noted that Dione Dell felt kind of
similar to Little River Gorge. An abseil down the middle of one of the
waterfalls to land in my first proper wet exit after an abseil almost
resulted in a dropped figure 8 trying to detach from the rope while
swimming!  Something to keep an eye on for next time, as that thing
would have been long gone down the bottom of the pool had it been
dropped (Always carry a spare, and know how to use a Munter!)

We hiked up out along the ridge, but as we neared the top we hit an
insummountable a cliff line. The instructions weren't clear which way
we needed to traverse, so we stumbled along, eventually clearing the
cliff and heading towards where the road was supposed to be. Wanting
to be sure that we wouldn't miss the road stumbling around in the
dark, we made the good decision to pull out the GPS, and soon learned
we had another 500m of scrub bashing to reach the road. It was
heartening just to learn that we were nearing our objective (and not
travelling away), despite the rigours of crawling through and around
stubborn bushes at night.

Starlight Canyon
-----------------

The drive to Newnes was an interesting one, as the roads were
exceptionally interesting. Tight corners, big drops, and a short
tunnel through Jenolan Caves provided plenty to look at as we
descended towards the greener low lands before turning off to
Newnes. The campground at Newnes was very popular, probably all up,
around 2,000 people staying there that weekend. The cliffs surround
the campsite, dominating the skyline, and providing an atmosphere that
will not soon be forgotten.
