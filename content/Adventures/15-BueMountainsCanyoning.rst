his Easter, I made the long car drive journey up to New South Whales
to join in the annual pilgrimage to go canyoning in the Blue
Mountains. With four drivers in the car, driving for 10 hours wasn't
seeming like such a horrible prospect. Along the way we stopped just
outside of canberra at one of the rest stops to join our friends in
the car ahead. There was tea and a fire in a can being hosted by some
kind volunteers who were there over Easter to promote driver safety,
they were really nice, and we decided to just get out our mats and
sleep under the picnic shelter.

The drive continued in the morning, but after a stop to admire a
sheep's behind, we managed to go an hour off course towards Sydney!
After turning back, the journey resumed, and we wound our way through
gradually smaller roads, until hitting the dirt shortly before
reaching Kanangra Boyd National Park.

After grabbing a bite to eat for lunch, we headed down into Dione
Dell. The decision to make our Blue Mountains Canyoning debut in this
location was based on the notion that this canyon offered numerous
chances to escape, should our intentions of working together
effectively and efficiently as a group begin to falter, as we had
never all been canyoning together.
