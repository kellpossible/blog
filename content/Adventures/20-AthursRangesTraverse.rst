hen people ask me what my favourite outdoor adventure was, it doesn't
take me long to think back on this amazing two weeks in the Tasmanian
wilderness while traversing the Western and the Eastern athurs ranges
with two friends Evie, Bryce and my Mum.

The story starts with my father recounting the experience of hiking in
the Western Athurs with his brother and another friend. For 3 days
they were trapped with bad weather at Square Lake in their A-Frame
canvas tent. With everything soaked, they eventually retreated to a
nearby cave. When the weather eventually broke, they beat a hasty
retreat back the way they had come. A second trigger for the trip idea
was the memories of a description from a friend in high schoolm when
he, his father and brothers traversed both the Western and the Eastern
Athurs.  The combination of remote and beautiful scenery, a challenge,
and a little bit of family history served to make idea of hiking this
route seem rather exciting.

Planning
------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the planning for the route, I painstakingly plotted the
expected track and points of interest in Google Earth, ready to save
onto our trusty, Garmin e-treks GPS unit.

Food planning was extensive, as we were going to carry enough food for
around 15 days of hard hiking on our back right from the very
beginning. After 2 days of walking, we planned to drop around 6 days
of food at the midpoint between the Western and Eastern Athurs where
we could collect it and continue the trip when we returned to that
point upon completing or retreating from the Western Athurs.


INSERT START TO CREEK JUNCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evie's parents live near Hobart, and they offered to host us upon
arriving there by plane on <insert day of week>. Evie's mum was very
kind to offer to drive us to the beginning of the hike the following
morning.

The first day was hard going with very heavy packs. Crawling under,
around or over the many fallen trees required patience and
determination. We stopped next to the river for lunch before
continuing to INSERT CAMPSITE HERE, arriving at twilight just as it
started to rain. Two ladies passed us here coming the opposite
direction having almost completed a 10 day round trip over the Western
Athurs.
