bored and fed up engineering student watching videos on his computer during summer break experienced that phenomenon so often attributed to wasting time on the YouTube website. One minute I was learning how to assemble a remote control aircraft, the next I got hooked watching paragliding videos, and finally I reached the channel of an individual who went on multi-day excursions, including climbing up into hostile New Zealand alpine terrain and launching from its peaks. During a previous visit to that country with family, these distant snow covered tops were constantly drawing my attention. While hiking up the Kepler Track from Te Anau the desire to break company with my casually ambling parents and siblings and run wildly off the path up the grass up to the snow and ice slopes was intense, but common sense prevailed. For the remainder of the trip, the high mountains took their place by the moon, their harsh beauty is undeniable and attractive to the adventurous type but there is always the knowledge that one cannot get there, and so its grip on you tends to fade away.
This person's simple act of documenting and sharing his day to day experiences climbing and flying in New Zealand and the Alps was enough to awaken renewed interest within me sitting in my room. All of a sudden these mountain places seemed a whole lot lower than the moon when an average bloke can record his weekend on a gopro camera walking up them and flying off.
Twelve months later I was eying off the icicles hanging high above my head, wondering how long it would take the sun to melt the biggest ones off. 
I considered carefully their weight and and shape, hey, they could do some damage... Hurry UP Richard! Not wanting to disturb my partner's concentration while he was leading the pitch, I held my tongue, but couldn't help but stare at them, ready to dodge. One by one, the younger siblings came tumbling down. On the positive side, I joked, returning with an icicle through the head would surely win us the safety shirt back at the hut tonight!

climbing in NZ left me with many clear/physical/visceral/photographic memories to dwell on for the foreseeable future. I can almost remember every ice screw we placed and every step over a crevasse. This is coming from someone who forgets things all the time lost gloves, rope on train! Etc

Nutella. Deserves a mention.
Lost a glove. Ticked me off.
