ollowing on from my previous article about mistakes.

	hey REDACTED, so 4 of us are thinking of Woolamai, while there are some
	easy climbs there, it's also inherently a more risky place than somewhere
	like Arapiles, Werribie Gorge, or Mt Macedon due to loose rock and waves +
	tide. I'd be okay with you climbing with me, but just thought I'd better
	mention that so you're at least partially aware that it involves more risk
	than usual. There'll definitely be more chances during the holidays too.
	Anyway your call if you'd still like to come, I'm easy either way.
