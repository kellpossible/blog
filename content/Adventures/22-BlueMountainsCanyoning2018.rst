:dropcap: O

nce again I found myself struggling on the 10 hour drive from
Melbourne to the Blue Mountains over the Easter Weekend. In the car
with me were 3 other intrepid folks, keen to taste the fresh, moist,
green air of the canyons in the Wollangambe area.

At about 9:45pm, deciding we were definitely unwilling to try Mc
Donalds at Glenrowan, "We're not going to Mc Donalds!", we pulled off
the highway and into the township of Benalla looking for some slightly
more appetizing sustenance. As we drove through town, we passed a very
closed looking pizza store, our first preference. The Indian
resteraunt was just about to close, and the prices on the menu made
our eyes water. And so it was, with our tails between our legs we
passed through the door to the golden arches. Can't say I'd be keen to
try the chicken wrap (without chicken) again!

Arriving at about 4am to the Mt Wilson campsite, we eventually found
our friend Taner's car in amongst the sea of Easter weekend
campers. This year was a much bigger crew of around 20. It was
something of a reunion for me, with friends from both Melbourne and
New South Wales present. Most of us met each other over the years
through connections between the various university outdoor clubs and
communities in Melbourne.

For a non-club, casual trip with a group of friends, everything was
surprisingly well organised. A Google spreadsheet created by Taner and
shared with everyone as contributers was an excellent tool for
coordinating transport and gear logistics before the trip in a
decentralized manner. While we were there, every morning groups would
form and write their names and canyoning intentions on a list in the
middle of our campsite. Each night, as the groups returned, we would
all keep an eye on the list and who had made it back to the
campfire. A few of us would stay awake until everyone returned so that
a rescue party could go out that night if the missing party failed to
show up. It was comforting knowing that people would be waiting for
you every night and able to respond quickly and effectively should
mishap occur.

Serendipity Canyon
------------------

The first morning, as an opener, David, Simin, Amy, Guillaume and
myself walked out of the campsite and down the track leading towards
Serendipity Canyon. In the beginning the canyon is fairly open, but it
tightens into a constriction with a fun abseil into passage of
swimming. In the afternoon we emerged shivering out into the valley
with the Wollangambe River and ate lunch in the sunshine before
jumping into the river from the rocks.

Claustral Canyon
----------------

Whenever someone talks about canyoning in New South Wales, Claustral
Canyon often comes to mind and gets a mention. Its reputation precedes
it. And so it was, on the second day the Serendipity Canyon crew
joined with an additional Keith and Lauren to clamber down through the
rainforest, sliding into the many pleasures that awaited us in
Claustral Canyon.

The most noteable feature of the canyon is a series of abseils into
the "Black Hole of Calcutta". I was amazed as we descended, we had our
headtorches turned on for the final abseil which starts from a small,
round hole through which the stream flows.

Finally at the bottom of this hole you emerge into one of the most
majestic sights I have ever encountered. The sunlight thrown in from
far above dances among the ferns and moss lining the walls. It casts
everything in an aura of green light.

As I caught up with the group, we discovered that Lauren had managed
to place her hand on the resident snake, who was lying sleepily on a
rock in the sunlight.

During the walk out of the canyon, we managed to lose the track and
had a bit of an epic night, but we made it back to camp by 10pm so
perhaps it wasn't so bad!

Going Home
----------

The final day we spent sport climbing and relaxing at the Dam Cliffs
climbing area near Lithgow.

On the way home on Tuesday we stopped in Gundagai for lunch. As we
parked, we noticed the door was open to an interesting looking
building. So I ran up to it and poked my head inside. It appeared to
be an old jail. The Guillaume and Amy followed me and we had a good
look around inside the old jail cells. We were about to leave when we
met an older couple who were also leaving. They looked surprised to
see us. They told us that you needed a key to get in, and they were
about to lock it up, we were almost locked up in Old Gundagai Jail!
