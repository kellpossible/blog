linda Falls is a fantastic spot for an escape from Melbourne via public transport + bike.
We jumped off the train at Boronia Railway Station, and rode our bikes up the *1 in 20* (Mountain Highway)
to Olinda. This trip would also be good to do on a hot day, as the Dandenongs is usually
nice and cool for riding.
