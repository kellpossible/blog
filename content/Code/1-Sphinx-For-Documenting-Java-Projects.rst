ast year I had the pleasure of using Sphinx for documenting my final year software project at university.
The project was primarily java, but also included a number of python utilities and the requirement of
documenting the central algorithm clearly. For the benefit of others I thought I would document our experience
using it and the configuration we ended up with.
