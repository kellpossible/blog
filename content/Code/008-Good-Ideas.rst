ow should you decide whether an idea is a "good idea"?

This post discusses the question mostly in the context of business
propositions, product ideas and process improvements, however I'm sure
the some of this could be applied to other walks of life.

This is a question I've been asking myself and thinking about in my
head for a few years now, but a discussion with a co-worker, with many
tangents, made me consider the value of placing these ideas down in
words so I can consider them further and form a more cohesive
perspective. This question comes from wanting to understand the
project management aspect to innovation, and also wanting to improve
my own process for generating and evaluating ideas for product
developement. I've had the chance to pitch a number of ideas in
companies, work on new ideas for university/industry projects, and
working on a number personal ideas. I've also had the opportunity to
work in product support and see some of the long term consequences of
design decisions. I want to think about these experiences and learn
from them, and try to discover better ways to do things, to improve.

We all get inspiration from somewhere. As I've progressed in my
various interests in outdoor sports, outside of the software industry,
it has become apparent to me how important it is to properly assess
risk, and to seek to methodically eliminate personal and group bias
when making decisions. We need to find a way to do this that is
practical and likely to be performed when it is needed. It has also
helped me to understand accidents and disasters are most often a
result of a string of small mistakes, rather than one large poor
decision. You need to be careful and diligent to catch these mistakes.

Many people rely heuristics decision making, mental shortcuts,
effective ways to reach a conclusion quickly and efficiently. Without
long years of *quality* training these shortcuts are likely to result
in mistakes. We need to learn when it is appropriate to trust our "gut
feeling" and when we need more application of "checklist" style
logical behaviour to our decision making. In writing this article, I'm
seeking to gain a better understanding of the heuristics involved, and
how to make decisions that result in less mistakes.

What is *quality* training for your heuristic decision making? It's
all about accurate feedback. In the world of outdoor sports, it is
difficult to receive quality training because many mistakes do not
result in any measurable negative feedback, and sometimes they can
even result in positive feedback. You need to seek carefully for
alternative sources of information in order to provide accurate
feedback on the quality of your decisions. You need to take the time
to sit down and analyse your decisions. You need to be willing to
subject yourself to the scrutiny of your peers, and others with more
experience.

Management and Personal Perspectives
------------------------------------

I've placed "good idea" in quotation marks because in my experience
what constitutes a "good idea" can be understood differently by
different people. How you assign value to different aspects of the
idea may vary greatly.

Firstly, looking at this question of "how good is the idea?" from a
project management perspective. Let's say I have a budget allocated
towards working on new ideas. I have a list of new ideas, some of
these are my own, some are from other people.

* How I decide what to work on next, what to allocate resources
  towards?
* What is the cost/benefit factor for this idea?
* What is the risk (uncertainty multiplied by the consequences) that
  is taken on by working on this idea?
* What kinds of project management and developement cycles are best
  applied to different kinds of ideas?
* How does a desire for time to market advantage affect the
  development process for the idea?

Secondly, looking at this same question from a more personal
perspective. Let's say I would like to work on some of my ideas. Why
does it need to be my idea? Where does this desire originate from?
Perhaps it is because when we have ideas, we are left wondering what
the outcome would be if they were taken to completion. In a sense, the
perhaps the desire to work on our own ideas is an attempt to satisfy
our curiosity. Maybe, we may think that our own ideas are better than
other people's ideas? Maybe we're right, or maybe we're blinded by
ego?

Some of these ideas may involve working on products for a company,
some of these ideas may involve a new business, or some of these may
just be personal projects for learning purposes where I don't care
what the outcome is, it's purely out of interest. For some of these
situations I rely on the support of other people (many of whom may
have very different perspectives to myself) in order to be able to
work on the idea, or for it to be able to gain traction and become a
success.

Even if it is a personal project, I still need to allocate my limited
personal time towards ideas and projects that I find valuable. The
time spent evaluating ideas in protracted "analysis paralysis" also
needs to be taken into account when crafting a better strategy around
this issue.

* Why do I want to work on my idea?
* What gets me excited about ideas?
* How do I seperate my decisions from my ego in order to improve their
  quality?
* How do I gain the support of others for an idea?
* How do I judge the quality of my own ideas, and decide which ones to
  spend more time on?
* How do I avoid being stuck in "analysis paralysis"?

I hope that by seeking to understand this topic from both
perspectives, knowledge will aid decisions made when I find myself in
the opposite seat.

In the sections below I will dive into these topics and questions a
little deeper.

What gets me excited about this idea?
-------------------------------------

I think this question can vary greatly according to personality,
experience, and the nature of the idea itself. Being honest when
seeking the answer to this question could be helpful in deciding more
objectively what value we want to place on the idea.

When we think about ideas, and we dream about the future where this
idea is implemented/solved/worked on, what are our hopes? In some
cases we may hope to gain something personally from the outcome. In
other cases, we may genuinely be wanting to help others with no
concern for our own gain or loss. Many situations will be some
combination of both.

How can we be confident about our conclusions?
----------------------------------------------

Many of my ideas which I was excited about when I was younger, I was
very confident about their value. It was easier for me then because I
did not consider many of the questions here, I did not see the need to
conduct more thorough analysis before declaring my idea "good".

Confidence is a product of many personal emotional and "gut feeling"
factors, not necessarily purely logicical. I recognise that I may have
personal biases which may make me feel more confident than the
situation deserves.

It's possible to take a very scientific approach, trying to find an
answer to the nth degree of accuaracy for any given question, however
one also needs to be practical and accept that time and other
resources available for answering this is limited. I think that it
should be possible to accept that each answer comes with some degree
of uncertainty, and we need to take this into account when considering
the idea as a whole. We may consider some questions more important
than others and seek to reduce the uncertainty in that area through
careful research, but still we must recognise that uncertainty
remains.

How useful will this new idea be?
---------------------------------

* Who will benefit from the use of this idea?
* How big is this target market, people who have similar needs and are
  likely to buy in?
* How long will the idea be useful for, when will it become most
  useful?

One could evaluate the usefulness of ideas based purely on whether we
believe that our idea will be useful for ourselves when we try to
place ourselves in our user's perspective. Maybe we are ourselves, our
own users, in which case perhaps we have a rather more informed
opinion, but to extrapolate this to others still requires some element
of guesswork.

How do we place ourselves in our user's perspective? This is a
question that I've grappled with quite a lot. What is an effective
technique depends very much on how close we are personally to the
target user group. While I might be accurate in quickly assessing
users who consist of myself, my friends, my workmates, people
performing the same job, etc, it is important to recognise that this
does not necessarily carry over to users who are further removed from
our own experiences. We need to be able to objectively recognise when
our opinion doesn't count for much in this regard.

If we find ourselves in a situation where our idea is specifically
targeted at users who are somewhat removed from our own spheres of
experience, it is important to rely on more scientific ways of drawing
conclusions about them and how they will perceive the idea. Market
research, prototyping and surveying, seeking out other experienced
opinions, competitor analysis; all these tools and more could be
employed to gain a better understanding on how useful an idea is.

How can this idea be marketed and sold?
---------------------------------------

* How will you market and sell the idea itself if it requires buy-in
  from others to proceed?
* Assuming your idea has been implemented, how will the result be
  marketed and sold?

These can be important questions if you personally consider the
potential product lifecycle, marketability and sellability a component
of the value for the idea.

Can you percieve people for whom it may be difficult to be convinced
that your idea is valuable? How valuable is their opinion, and how can
you go about changing it?

Do you have competetitors, how do you think their future actions and
very existence could affect your idea in this regard?

Perhaps it is difficult to sell a product based on the idea because
due to it's nature, monetizing is impractical. Maybe it is easy and
common for people to circumvent your attempt to monetize the
idea. Maybe the value offered by the product idea does not match well
with the method to be employed for monetization. What are your options
and which is the best? I think the answer to this comes back to
understanding the users, and understanding the industry, both of which
require considerable learning to attain.

Perhaps it is difficult to market an idea because it is considered too
radical? Many ideas which are today considered "ahead of their time",
were at the time, poorly received by the market at the time. Perhaps
they were indeed poorly marketed and sold, or perhaps it was just a
case of the right idea at the wrong time. Perhaps there needs to be
some intermediate stepping stones to make the idea more palletable.

Who stands to lose from the success of this idea?
--------------------------------------------------

Assuming your project for implementing the idea was successful, who,
after implementation, stands to lose something as a result? Perhaps it
may have unintented or inconsiderate side-effects? History has plenty
of bold examples of this, where perhaps with a little more forethought
such consequences could have been avoided, however even small scale
projects can suffer from the same problem. Perhaps you may be entering
into competition with a partner. Perhaps you may be increasing someone
else's workload or stress levels.

Who stands to lose from the failure of this idea?
-------------------------------------------------

You may lose time, you may lose opportunities, you may lose money. Or
perhaps someone else, or some other entity invested in the project may
stand to lose a great deal more than yourself. However at an early
stage, I think these thoughts should not get in the way of the desire
to take the idea further and test its value with more research and
low cost prototyping.

Who stands to gain from the failure of this idea?
-------------------------------------------------

Yourself of course! A lot can be learned from failure, however it can
come at a cost. You don't want to learn about avalanche safety by
being buried in an avalanche, your odds are not good once you're in
there. Try to catch and identify failures early, and don't let them
stack up.

What are the potential roadblocks?
----------------------------------

How much will it cost to implement?
-----------------------------------

How long will it take to implement?
-----------------------------------
(linked to cost of course)

How risky is this idea?
-----------------------

Risk = probability of failure * consequences

Does this risk level align with the company's risk appetite?

Maybe the risk seems fine for me, but it isn't fine for other people,
for whom the decision relies upon, and who also will bear the outcome,
good or bad.

With each of these elements, how sure am I about the information, how
risky does this make the project?


Asked about my confidence, am I really confident in my ideas? Has
working at ANCA affected my confidence. I would say yes. Is this a
problem, not necessarily, if my confidence was previously
misplaced.  Even when I try to base
decisions on fact, my personal bias will have an effect in any grey
areas of the decision making, of which there are always some.


How to avoid "analysis paralysis"?
----------------------------------

After all this analysis, one might ask, how do we avoid doing too much
of it for our ideas?
