My torch flickers, and then goes out. Halfway through the second pitch,
I call out below something to make my belayer worried. Stopping to take
stock, behind me are yells and hoots, a couch burning bonfire rages in
the campsite. Our friend is making funny noises around the corner on
Agamemnon. Waiting was worthwhile, the moon shines through and lights
the route ahead.”* - 30th June 2015

*“It was dark, so we backed off from a climb and went exploring for
another way up the Horn instead. We found a cave which lead to nowhere,
that was fun. We then found ourselves a bit lost and bush bashing.
Finally someone at the carpark heard us\!”* - Mid 2015

*“Stepping away from my partner and out over the void. I've been here
during the day, I know what it looks like down below, but in the
darkness the imagination can have free reign.”* - 20th of June 2016

*“Excited to have made it to the top. With the air clear between us, Mt
Buller floats like a sky city between the clouds.”* - 8th of July 2016

*“We sit perched at the top of the tower as the light fades and waves
crash below. It’s getting cold, but I would happily sit here all
night”*- 29th of October 2016

To me, the night is exciting and irresistibly appealing. With sight
diminished, I find myself paying more attention to my partners, and the
other senses. The experience becomes a little surreal. I do struggle
with balancing the desire to prance under the starlight with the voice
of reason, comfort and safety. I know that climbing, skiing and even
walking at night holds an extra element of risk, but romantic notions
often get the better.

Coming to the realisation this past year that this particular personal
factor has had the ability to affect my ability to make rational and
safe decisions prompted a deeper look into why this occurs, and what can
be done about it.

Human factors are the primary factors in a large percentage of outdoor
accidents. You can be an expert in hazard evaluation and risk evaluation
in your chosen activity, but this will take a back seat if through
overconfidence, complacency, arrogance, or a whole host of other
personal reasons and emotions you decide to ignore your better judgement
and continue anyway.

The study *Evidence of Heuristic traps in recreational avalanche
accidents* by Ian McCammon and Bruce Temper’s *Staying Alive in
Avalanche Terrain* identify a number of number of “simple rules” or
“mental shortcuts” that humans appear to unconsciously follow when
presented with complex situations:

  - Familiarity, we tend to be more comfortable in situations with which
    we are familiar. For example, if you are familiar with being at
    heights, you get more comfortable with it, and as a result are more
    likely to take risks while at heights.
  - Acceptance, we like to seek acceptance from others.
  - Commitment, when we are committed to a goal or to an identity we
    wish to attain/sustain.
  - “Expert Halo”, completely trusting and relying on the decisions of
    those we perceive to be experts.
  - Competition/Scarcity, when something is in short supply, or we are
    competing with others.
  - “Social Proof”, when we feel more comfortable following the opinion
    of the crowd, “herd mentality” and perception of safety in numbers.
  - “Risk Homeostasis”, our risk appetite/tolerance is fairly stable in
    the short term. Advances in risk management technology or technique
    which are considered to reduce risk in our activities result in us
    deciding to undertake correspondingly riskier activities in order to
    maintain this appetite that satisfies our cravings.

Recognising the factors within ourselves which affect our ability to
make quality decisions in the outdoors, and being honest about them to
both ourselves, and to our partners could go a long way towards being
able to reduce their unwanted impact on the choices we make.

It’s also possible that a group may consciously and deliberately submit
to some of these factors. A little competition, commitment to a goal,
leadership respect and an appetite for risk aren’t necessarily a bad
thing if they are carefully considered, limited, accepted and monitored
by every group member. Looking back, I notice that on a number of
occasions (especially ones in which I was personally involved), when
this care is not taken, situations can rapidly spiral out of control and
become unacceptable for the entire group, or for individuals within the
group.

With the right mindset, the right people, the right skills, and some
functional head-torches, adventuring under the stars can be super
enjoyable, with little by way of regret.
