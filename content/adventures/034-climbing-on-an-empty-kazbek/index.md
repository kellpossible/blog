During our time in Gomi a few of us talked about a summer climb of
Kazbek, one of the most notable peaks in Georgia. Taylor, Eva, Arina
and myself committed to the endeavour, they managed to scrounge
together the climbing specific gear required, and we loaded up in
Taylor's van for the drive over Gudauri to Stepantsminda. Anya stayed
in Tbilisi during this time. With us were a box of bagels provided to
us by a friendly Australian who started a bagel baking business in
Tbilisi. Not sure if it was the bagels, but at some point during the
drive we all began to experience flatulence which would set the tone
for the trip!

We spent the night in a guest house in Stepantsminta, and in the
morning we drove up to the trailhead. The typically busy carpark was
now occupied by pack horses being loaded up with hut construction
material. The hike out of the valley is mellow and enjoyable, and
before we knew it, we had a view of the Gergeti glacier. We opted to
walk up the rocks to the left of the white ice toe of the glacier
before crossing it to reach Meteostation. Probably next time I would
choose to just don crampons and climb the ice, as there were no
significant obstacles on the glacier itself, and it's tough work
climbing sliding rocks with blue ice hidden underneath.

The Meteostation building is huge, and the number of campsites there
is difficult to count, and it was completely empty! We were clearly
lucky to have this opportunity to have the mountain to ourselves in
Summer. We set up our tents, and the building manager invited us into
his room for tea, and we spent the evening watching Lord of the Rings
dubbed in Georgian. During the night Taylor's tent was ripped open by
a cheeky camp fox in search of bagels.

On day 2 we went for an acclimitazation hike up to 4000m, luckily this
also allowed us to plug steps in the now soft snow drifts which lay
across the path. On day 3 we woke up very early, sometime around 4am
or earlier, and hiked out of camp. Our previous day's steps were very
useful in the now icey snow drifts, and we soon reached the point of
the glacier at around 4000m where we stepped onto the snow of the
glacier and roped up. We walked slowly up to the saddle between
Spartak and Kazbek at 4450m. Here it became clear that Arina was not
going to be able to continue, she was feeling sick from the altitude,
we probably needed to spend more time acclimatizing. I was still full
of energy, and I requested 1.5h to make a solo dash to the
summit. Ahead of us high up on the mountain a group from the Russian
side were almost at the summit, unfortunately there were no tracks
from our side to follow. I was plugging through fresh snow and only
made it to a large crevasse with a small snow bridge at about 4880m
just below the ridge to the summit before having to turn around, I was
out of time anyway.

Meanwhile Taylor and Eva conquered Spartak, and we all met again in
the saddle with Arina. As we were walking down, the skies opened up
with sleet and the wind began to howl. Taylor's tent pole snapped in
the wind. We were glad that we had turned around early. The next
morning Taylor and Eva decided they wanted to make another summit
attempt, Arina and I would walk down together as I needed to return to
civilization earlier for work. I was awoken before sunrise by
Taylor. They had already returned, Eva overcome with stomach problems
early into their attempt. Instead we all took our sleeping bags and
cooking stuff to a nearby ridge and cooked breakfast salami while
watching the sun rise.
