The Vagabond ski instructor group decided to leave Guduari to live on a property
in the countryside. Initially they hoped to live on a property not far from
Bakuriani owned by a family member from the group, however it was complicated
with family members living on the property. Instead, they found a place in the
tiny town of Gomi, in the Guria region, near Ozergheti. They would be helping a
friend Lika to build a campsite called Dumbo Eco Camp. After a short stay in
Tbilisi, and quick visit to the Black Sea near Kobuleti with Alex and Lena, we
joined the group in Guria, sleeping in our small tent under the hazlenut groves
next to the river. It's warm and humid in Guria, with a thunderstorm being a
common occurance in the evenings during Summer. I loved walking in barefoot on
the grass, and swimming in the cold river with our friends.

A local, a large and dominating 50-60 year old man, Lasha invited us over for a
lavish Georgian supra a number of times. We watched the ducks swimming around in
his mud lined ponds, and the chickens being bred nearby. He peppered us with
gifts in what probably turned out to be an attempt to find some people to run
his new guest house. We were all rather intrigued by his purpose, and he even
gifted us a number of antique sewing machines! We went for a drive through the
rainforest of Gomi to visit the honey guy to commission some honey for our
group. He appeared at the gate shirtless and very comical, probably quite drunk
on honey chacha.

We caught some dogs rummaging around our trash and breaking into the compost
bin, one of whom was the beatiful, and crazy Bobic, who we all came to love and
hate, a major character of the Gomi story.

Some of our friends began to make plans to leave Georgia and return to Europe
soon. Anya and I had organised to be married in Moscow, however due to the
unravelling COVID situation it became clear that we could not follow that plan.
Sitting at the table with all our friends, we decided that we could just make a
wedding in 3 days, Lika was a wedding planner after all and she declared it was
possible! Before we knew what was happening we had booked for our marriage at
the service hall, and planned an informal ceremony to take place on top of the
nearby Gomi mountain. We invited our family and friends to join us on a Zoom
video call, someone said they had an internet connection on the mountain, but we
had no time to test the theory!

Anya spent her bachelorette's party the next day in Batumi with the
girls, and I joined the guys for dinner at a restaurant in the hills
behind Batumi, and we carried our sleeping stuff down to a beautiful
beach near Tsikhisdziri. We were invited over to the campsite of a
group of free spirits living on the beach in makeshift tents, and
beautiful cups and table made from bamboo cut from the nearby
forest. One of the beach residents was a young man from Turkmenistan,
who told us many intriguing and sad stories about life in that
country, including how he was unable to return without facing
consequences because he had spent too much time abroad!  When we woke
up in the morning with the sun, we ate a watermelon for breakfast, and
watched our new friends dive naked into the waves.

The dress that Anya had ordered from Russia for our originally planned
wedding had not arrived in Georgia after 3 months of shipping time, it
was stuck somewhere on the border, so Anya rushed around Batumi at the
last minute with Eva trying to find something that would work. We were
unable to find wedding rings in Batumi, so I spent the afternoon
fashioning some out of bamboo from the campsite.

In the morning some of our friends appeared with beautiful flowers
from town, and two Mitsubishi Delicas rolled through the gate to take
us up the rocky Gomi Mountain road. Halfway up we paused to drink some
wine offered to us by the drivers and to give carsick Diana a break
from the hectic road! We were approaching the cloud, and I was nervous
that our wedding might have no view, but we broke through into the sun
and it was an incredible and surreal feeling. The view opened up, the
rolling green hills, and the ramshackle village of Gomi Mountain, all
floating above the clouds extending in every direction.

We reached the cross at the top of the mountain, but the telephone signal
quality there was very poor. I was worried we would be unable to conduct the
zoom call. Taylor and I ran off barefoot down a different side hill to see if we
could find something better, but nothing better could be found. I returned
stressed and sweaty, Anya also was feeling nervous. Thankfully her phone must
have a better antenna, and managed to get just enough signal for a video call,
so we decided to set up just below the cross.

Our friend Chris performed the ceremony, he was a great orator. The
cloud drifted in and out, and I watched Anya's beatiful face gather
droplets. Afterwards we cracked the champaign and partied! As we drove
down the mountain, I received a text message that our wedding
certificate was ready to be collected at the service hall, so Anya and
I continued there with our two Georgian friends Sopo and Lika as
witnesses, a small miracle it was ready on the same day as the
ceremony.

I drove with Lika to collect the wedding cake she had organised to be
made for us, something delicious covered in stawberries. We were soon
all sitting for dinner at the newly made table under the shelter in
the campsite. Two Gomi locals Anzori and TODO: name, brought us
another cake and fireworks as gifts. We spent our first married
night sleeping on a small couch out on the veranda of the house, and
the rain absolutely bucketed down during the night, spraying me on the
outside.

The next day we got a lift into Ozergheti, and took a marshutka (mini
bus) to the Black Sea, where we took advantage of COVID prices and
stayed in a luxury 5 star hotel above the beach which resembles a
disney castle with an infinity pool. Walking down the road to reach
the hotel, we passed many stunning Eucalyptus specimens, this region
is full of them, and it reminded me of home.
