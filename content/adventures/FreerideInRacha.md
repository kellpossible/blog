Having spent a lot of time on skis over the past 4 years in Georgia, it's easy for me to say that the region of Racha has captured my heart. Nestled between the famous region of Svaneti in the West of the country and North Ossettia in the central North, Racha is a hidden gem, a network of valleys and remote villages that calls to those in search of genuine adventure.

One of the main attractions for Racha is the multitude of North Facing valleys in Upper Racha, which provide great snow conditions. During the Spring it's also possible to head up higher to the glaciers on the border with Russia.

My love affair with Racha began when Ryan my alpine climbing partner began to tell me about his business [Snow Vigil](https://www.snow-vigil.org/) which he started with another friend Adam. Snow Vigil operates with the idea to bring people into Racha to experience the unique culture and excellent terrain and snow conditions that are on offer there. He described to me the challenges they faced operating in the area which has almost no tourism infrastructure, and the amount of unexplored terrain which remains for those who are willing to put in the hard yards. Many of the interesting zones benefit greatly from camping, as the approaches are long, and sometimes arduous, but, importantly, compared to Australia or New Zealand, they can be done with skins on from the road.


## Exploring 2020/2021 Season

After Ryan's introduction I was immediately sold on the idea of skiing in Racha. It was 2020, and it seemed likely that the tourism season would be a write-off due to COVID travel restrictions, so instead, our group of friends, consisting of Snow Vigil and [Vagabond Adventures](https://vagabondadventures.ge/) team members decided to make a mini expedition of sorts and spend much of the 2020/2021 season in Racha. We negotiated to rent a house in the town of Oni, so we could base ourselves there to explore more of what was on offer in the region.

For the first tour we organised was a 3 day trip up to the Shoda Valley. Just South of the town of Ghebi in upper Racha, the Shoda valley is a North facing valley, with large peaks looming on either side of a striking headwall at the end of the valley. Getting to Ghebi in Winter is always an adventure in itself. We travelled in Ryan's Delica, and my Subaru Outback, the road at that time was fairly bad, however we made it into the town of Ghebi without a problem, but traversing the narrow ice covered streets and laneways inside the town proved to be the biggest obstacle! We've since learned that it's usually faster to start a tour here from outside the town and ski through the streets.

Crossing the stream and heading up the trail towards the church, our group of about 14 people eventually reached the traverse where the trees open up and the impressive peaks are unveiled above the valley. I was immediately struck by the beauty of the location, and we placed our tent next to the old summer herdsmen huts as the sun began to set.

The next morning was fresh, with a clear sky, we made our way up the bench on the West side of the valley, and dug several snow pits as we ascended. There was an average of more than 3m snow coverage, which was stable in every test result. The apparent stability, and the lack of any evidence of recent avalanches, or recent snowfall, encouraged us to proceed up the headwall at the end of the valley, which is fairly steep, up to 45 degrees. On the next morning, some members of the group who had elected to rest the previous day also wanted to head up to the headwall, so we once again ascended in our tracks again. 

This time I decided to also give one of the beautiful benches on the West side a crack, but the snow was still very soft there, and it is very steep, maybe 50+ degrees, so I only made enough progress for about 2 turns before we needed to head back. While I was climbing I also discovered a large glide crack which was entirely covered by snow, for a second my heart stopped and I thought I had stuck my leg into a crevasse!

We made it back to the campsite in the afternoon quickly packed up the tents, and began the traverse over past the church to the top of the descent. It was clear that we were in for an interesting evening, the sun was already beginning to set, and the snow at the lower altitude had developed the worst possible breakable crust. Combining this with overnight backpacks made for slow/tricky downhill progress between the trees! I was worried someone might break a leg. Anya had a run in with a tree and hurt her arm, so we decided that walking would be safer and faster. Somehow everyone got separated and it was a bit of chaos because we didn't make a plan to stick together. I eventually began carrying Anya's backpack too to help her, and then while climbing over a fallen tree managed to punch through to a hole and fell on my face in the snow and got stuck!

When we made it back to the cars, the last ones to arrive, everyone had taken shelter in one of the village homes, the owners had kindly invited them inside for some chacha and hot food. We said goodbye and started preparing the cars to leave, when Ryan discovered that one of his tires was flat, necessitating a change, we spent quite a while searching and asking nearby for a suitable base for the jack to stop it sinking into the snow.

With a huge dump of snow and bad weather incoming, the next trip was planned as a camp at Shkmeri, which lies on the new road between Tbilisi and Oni. The road had not been completed at that stage, so the road was not being cleared of snow. We decided to leave the Subaru, with it's lower clearance, down at the bottom of the mountain, and do a car shuttle with the Delica to get everyone to the start of the skin track.

The walk in was pleasant, mostly flat, between some trees for a few kilometers to reach a cozy camping spot next to the creek, just below the mountain facing North East on the South side of the highway. The snow began to dump, and by the second day we were having some fantastic powder laps! In the afternoon eeveryone was pretty well soaked and the stoke for camping another night was not high, we decided to head back home. When we got back to the car it was clear that the drive out was going to be an ordeal with almost 50cm of new snow on the road. Additionally, someone had decided to steal Ryan's jack and traction pads from the roof of his car! 

Not everyone was going to fit in the Delica, so we decided to split up, half going back in the Delica and the other half skiing out along the road. Levi and Eva took up ropes to surf behind the car all the way down. I stayed with the walking group, and as we passed the township of Usholta, Louis, a diabetic, informed us that he was feeling unwell and that he had run out of sugar, the rest was with his backpack which had been sent down the mountain with the Delica! With no opportunity for us to retrieve it, luckily Kaƒçka had some spare snickers bars, which kept Louis going until we caught up with his backpack down the hill.

Having only had a small taste, it was time for Anya and I to leave, and we drove back to Tbilisi to fly to Kamchatka, while the rest of the group continued the season exploring in Racha.


## Volunteering for Snow Vigil 2021/2022

We returned to Georgia in the Summer, with the borders now open and travel seeming possible once again, Ryan and Adam were making plans to run some Snow Vigil trips in the upcoming 2021/2022 season. 




## Snow Vigil

To organise a personal trip to Racha is a large logistical exercise, especially for those who are only coming to Georgia for a short time for a holiday, or if it is their first visit to the country, it could be very difficult. Snow Vigil combines knowledge of the area, professional guides to provide a level of safety in a remote area without an avalanche forecast or fast rescue services, and logistical support so you can spend more time on your holiday skiing and less time shopping, cooking or searching for transport and accommodation (which can be very difficult to do online in Georgia!). They also can provide a lot of the equipment necessary for doing the trips such as sleeping bags, tents, etc, reducing the luggage you need to cart around.

All that being said, what Snow Vigil currently offers in Racha is not a style of trip for everyone, one needs to embrace the spirit of adventure, and accept the lack of infrastructure in the area. There are no luxury hotels in upper Racha, and comfortable guest housing is limited. You may be spending some nights in tents, perhaps the power might cut out and you'll be eating dinner by candle light, perhaps the running water supply will be frozen and you'll be having a wonderful bucket bath next to a steamy hot stove instead of a shower (can confirm it's nice!). On another night perhaps you'll be sleeping in a creeky old abandoned summer hut at the head of a remote valley surrounded by fresh pow surrounded by beautiful lines with first descents on offer.

In some sense the kind of people who would be attracted to this would also be capable of planning their own trip to either Mestia or Gudauri without much trouble, however the hope is that the greater sense of adventure and the unknown may prevail and Snow Vigil can find clients who are inexorably drawn to the Racha for the same reasons that they are.
