## Maps

Soviet, and American Military maps of Kamchatka are [available on
mapstor](https://mapstor.com/map-sets/russia-maps/kamchatka-krai.html),
which have some more names for places, and better indications of
vegetation/cliffs/glaciers but the roads/tracks may not be accurate to
present day conditions.

<https://opentopomap.org/> has many of the hiking tracks, roads, and ski
lifts on it, and I've found myself using it very often here.

## Public Transport

For city buses, I have been using <https://www.openstreetmap.org/> to
find the name of a bus stop near the desired destination, then jump
onto <https://transport.kamgov.ru/> to find which bus numbers go to that
location.

For buses outside of the city <https://busget.ru/> ?? I'm not sure,
there was a different website that Anya used to find березняки.
