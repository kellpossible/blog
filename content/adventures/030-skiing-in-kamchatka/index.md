This year I spent several months living in Kamchatka during Winter spending time
with my girlfriend. I came with the personal goals of exploring as much of the
peninsula as possible on skis, to climb and ski at least one volcano, and to
perhaps find some work experience in the tourism industry. This post is a
reflection on what I experienced, and some information for others who wish to
come here for independent backcountry skiing.

As a person who currently speaks only a little Russian, and strives to recreate
independently and without spending exorbitant amounts of money on entirely
catered tourist trips, finding people to ski with in the backcountry in
Kamchatka is very challenging. For an outsider, are no obvious clubs or social
network groups that I can find catering to those who want to meet others to go
backcountry skiing with (ски-тур) recreationally. This makes me appreciate all
the more, the wealth of clubs and groups we have back home in Melbourne,
Australia which I have benefited from and participated in. Someone really should
start one here!

Having said all that, I still met some wonderful new friends for skiing with.

## Maps

Soviet, and American Military maps of Kamchatka are [available on
mapstor](https://mapstor.com/map-sets/russia-maps/kamchatka-krai.html), which
have some more names for places, and better indications of
vegetation/cliffs/glaciers but the roads/tracks may not be accurate to present
day conditions.

<https://opentopomap.org/> has many of the hiking tracks, roads, and ski lifts
on it, and I found myself using it very often there. <https://mapy.cz> has
English transcriptions for many of the names of places and appears be based on
the same data-set.

## Public Transport

For city buses, I have been using <https://www.openstreetmap.org/> to
find the name of a bus stop near the desired destination, then jump
onto <https://transport.kamgov.ru/> to find which bus numbers go to that
location.

For buses outside of the city <https://busget.ru/> ?? I'm not sure,
there was a different website that Anya used to find березняки.
