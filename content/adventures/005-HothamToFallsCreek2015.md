We predicted much suffering and grim struggle for survival while on the 2
day crossing from Mt Hotham to Fall's Creek. At the end of 40 hours
emergency services and family will be notified of our failure to arrive.
At the 60 hour mark, search parties will fan out from either end of the
trail, looking high and low among the snowgums for our persons.
Satellite photographs of the area have been scheduled to be taken every
hour to aid in the investigation. The steep valley down to Dibbins hut
where the parties will inevitably meet is rumoured to be treacherous in
winter. Icicles poised to drop on heads just one of the many concerns
and obstacles expected in this remote region. An extra 8 days worth of
food for contingency purposes, along with minus 30 degree sleeping bags
for every party member. The the imposing Mt Jim Massif is rumoured to
affect compass bearings, and could well interfere with radio and GPS
communications too. Several Kilometres of coloured string will therefore
need to be taken to aid backtracking in whiteout conditions.

And so it was quite the shock that we returned well fed, a little
tanned, and thoroughly excited after what was at least for me the most
enjoyable weekend skiing one could ask for. The only way it could have
been better is if we'd decided to take the helicopter back to Hotham
instead of the bus\!
