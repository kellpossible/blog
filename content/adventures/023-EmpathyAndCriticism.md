We tell ourselves (and our friends and families) that our adventure sport
of choice can be safe, you shouldn't get hurt if you do the right thing;
that person who had an accident must have been doing something wrong or
was unlucky. We've convinced ourselves that it's safe enough for us to
be comfortable participating, and when some evidence comes up to the
contrary, we may seek to disprove or minimise it so we can feel better
about our own selfish choices regarding risk taking.

This week I was struck by the [sad news of the death of promising young
female climber Savannah
Buik](http://rockandice.com/climbing-news/remembering-savannah-buik) and
[the conversation surrounding
it](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/88780n/reconciling_risk/).
What happens when we try to reconcile the risk in our pursuits when
faced with horrifying news such as this? It makes me think about all my
friends and acquaintences who have suffered accidents, bad luck, and
near misses in the outdoors. It makes me think about all those articles
about people who made *"silly"* mistakes and got themselves killed.

There is a line we must tread between trying to identify mistakes and
criticising them in the name of progress/improvement, but also being
empathetic and respectful towards the person who had the accident,
accepting that we ourselves can be exposed to the same risks and are
capable of making the same kinds of mistakes.

Over the years I've overheard or even participated several discussions
which take an overly critical tone. I've often left feeling guilty. The
person in question often has an idea that people are gossiping about
their accident. They may feel excluded from the conversation, and feel
that other people look down upon them. Damage is certainly done.

To add to this is our impression that perhaps sharing personal stories
of our poor decisions (especially those near misses) publicly damages
our reputation and the reputation of our clubs/companies/communities,
making us appear reckless and dagerous. It might make others question
our personal suitability for taking on leadership responsibilities?

know")}}

Of course, unfortunately, considerations for admission of guilt and
culpability in the context of litigation increasingly plays a part in a
number of accident scenarios in our societies, but I would like to argue
that these considerations when applied liberally are also toxic to a
healthy safety culture.

I don't speak for my club on this, but I personally believe it is far
better that we as a club and as individual members of our respective
communities strive have a reputation of being open, honest, and willing
to learn from our mistakes. Other clubs and experienced adventurers may
have a good looking public safety record, but I can guarantee that they
probably have had many problems, accidents and near misses which go
unreported, and undiscussed.

Yes it's important that we try to discourage out of place bravado, poor
technique and poorly thought out decisions regarding risk. But I think
we often aren't giving people enough credit and encouragement to come to
this conclusion themselves. Who better to criticise and share details
about an accident or a near miss than the person who was themselves
involved?

If you know someone who has had an accident or a near miss, before
launching into criticising/reporting their mistakes behind their backs
consider doing this first instead: talk to them about it if they are
willing. Be empathetic, be *very* careful to avoid implying judgement.
They may feel shame, or they may not even realise the full extent of
their mistake, which may be why they have not told you about it of their
own accord. Build up a rapport with them on the subject, ask careful
questions and help them to to feel comfortable identifying and sharing
their own mistakes with others. It may even be that you are not the best
person to do approach them, perhaps they will be more comfortable
talking to another friend, so delegate this responsibility\!

To open the proceedings, a story about one of my own near misses, a
couple of weekends ago I was in a canyon with some friends:

> *We were approaching the end of the difficult sections and nearing the
> end of the canyon, everyone was euphoric with the beauty of the
> surroundings. The final obstacle to negotiate was a hand-over-hand fixed
> line down into a pool of water. perhaps 5m below. I was feeling cocky,
> confident and happy, I knew that this was going to be easy for me. I was
> also the last person in the group and there was a friend watching out
> for me while the others walked on ahead.*

If you've had a personal accident or a near miss you'd like to share,
consider writing about it, and sharing it with your friends, and perhaps
the world at large. Besides helping yourself process what's happened,
you never know how you may be helping to improve the experience of
others in the outdoors.
