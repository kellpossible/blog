Olinda Falls is a fantastic spot for an escape from Melbourne via public
transport + bike. We jumped off the train at Boronia Railway Station,
and rode our bikes up the *1 in 20* (Mountain Highway) to Olinda. This
trip would also be good to do on a hot day, as the Dandenongs is usually
nice and cool for riding.
