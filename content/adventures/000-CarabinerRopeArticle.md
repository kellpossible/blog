I recently had the misfortune of cutting the sheath midway along a brand
new rope whilst taking a catching a lead fall while climbing indoors.
How might this happen? Climbing gyms are carefully controlled
environments. The quickdraws on the wall that get used during lead
climbing are likely checked for damage, or excessive wear and replaced
on a regular basis. The holds are not sharp, and the climbs are designed
in a way which has relatively low rope wear. It’s hard to imagine such a
thing happening indoors.

We soon discovered that whilst belaying the falling climber, the belay
carabiner flipped over and became cross loaded. This is a situation
whereby the load on the carabiner is across its short axis, with either
the rope, or the harness pulling directly on the gate of the biner. One
thing to note is that carabiners are usually rated to only a fraction of
their strength when they are loaded in this way, so this is a situation
one should be avoiding. Carabiners used for belaying are normally an
asymmetrical shape, where one end is smaller than the other. This helps
to prevent cross loading. In my case, the point on the gate between the
closing screw and the hinge where it is joined to the body of the biner
at the hinge has sharp edges. Evidence in the form of sheath material
wedged in the hinge goes to show that for some carabiner designs it is
possible for the rope to become wedged and trapped in this position. The
lip on the body of the biner helped to stop the rope sliding off the
gate as it was loaded during the fall. As the rope traveled over the
gate in this position, the sharp edges cut the sheath, leaving material
wedged in the hinge. The carabiner brand were very helpful, and replaced
the rope, so no hard feelings there, but I have several things to take
away from this which I’d like to share:

  - Always check your own new equipment for defects. In this case, it
    seems likely that it was a deficit in the design which I would not
    have been able to recognise, but it is entirely possible that a new
    piece of equipment could have obvious dangerous defects, which a
    quick observation could point out. I tend to place a large amount of
    trust in the equipment we use while climbing, especially when it is
    new, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t check it before we use it.
  - Carabiner designs, while tried and tested, could be improved. A
    simple bevel on this sharp edge would have greatly reduced its
    potential to cut a rope.
  - Save up and get yourself a special belay carabiner such as the
    Gridlock from Black Diamond or the Belay Master from DMM. If used
    correctly, these eliminate the possibility of cross-loading
    occurring while belaying your partner.
