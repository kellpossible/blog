Like sentinels, Koryaksky, Avachinsky and Kozelsky stand watch over
the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. As a mountain adventure lover,
the beauty and allure of these volcanoes cultivate the
imagination. Going about your daily business, walking to the shops or
riding in the bus, occasionally the red glow of a sunset on the jagged
peak, or the white fumaroles billowing out of the crater will catch
your eye, and hold you in fascination.

From December through to March I was living on the Kamchatka Peninsula with my
girlfriend (now fiance!) Anna, who is a local there. There has been plenty of
time for adventure, and I've been able to get out on many interesting
backcountry ski trips close to the city, with Anna and her friends. Even so,
with more time on my hands than most, and the desire to get out and explore the
place, I found myself heading out on more solo trips. I've previously written
about my desire to find partners for trips when [I was in New Zealand last
year](/adventures/ski-mountaineering-nz/), and have since had more time to
reflect on this topic, and the events of that season.

As February rolled on in, Kamchatka has experienced, what I am told is, an
unseasonably long spell of fine weather, several weeks without significant
snowfall, with a decent depth of snow already in place. From an avalanche
perspective, exploring some of the larger peaks in the area wasn't seeming like
such a bad idea, despite it still being February. Generally they come into
season in Spring. A recon trip (and Christmas gift from Anna) to Avachinsky pass
on the 2nd of January on snowmobile had not revealed any visible recent evidence
of activity over the wide range of aspects and elevations visible, other than
perhaps a crown line up near the summit of Koryaksky up at about 3200m. There
was one main problem, I didn't yet have a partner for such a trip. Experience
and reflection has gradually made me more cautious when considering travelling
with a new partner on serious mountains (where the consequences of a mistake
could easily be fatal). For several reasons finding someone who is available and
that I can trust this time was proving difficult.

{{img(path="photos/alone-on-avachinsky/20200102_120124.jpg",

Several factors were not working in my favour here. I don't speak
fluent Russian, and not many people in Kamchatka speak fluent
English. Communication with your partner is of prime importance in the
mountains, problems understanding each other can easily lead to big
mistakes, and awkward situations at the least. This is my first time
to Kamchatka in the Winter, and I have not had much time to meet new
partners and build up a history and mutual understanding on smaller
trips. I have bucket-loads of free time and am lucky to be in a
position where I can look at the snow conditions and the weather
forecast, and choose the best day for a given trip. Not everyone has
this luxury, and I would warrant there aren't many people staying in
Kamchatka with a similar plan (ski/explore as much as possible for
several months) that I could possibly find and join forces with,
unlike other more popular ski destinations.

And so the thought of going alone (already having several solo trips
in less serious terrain under my belt) began to germinate. I talked
earnestly with with some friends, and read some interesting articles on
the topic. I noticed that some people appear to state strong opinions
without presenting carefully chosen arguments. How much riskier is
going solo vs skiing with a partner/partners? How does this risk
level/comparison vary depending on, personal experience, what terrain
will be covered, what the snow conditions are like, and who potential
partners are? Does the presence of a two way satellite communication
device (such as an InReach) offset some of the additional risks of
travelling solo, to within one's personal risk appetite/boundary?

[Ski or board backcountry alone?  Don't be an
idiot](https://www.snowsbest.com/ski-or-board-off-piste-alone-dont-be-an-idiot/)
offers one perspective, with a very strong tone of warning. One
personal take-away from this article was that accidents such as
tree-well deaths, and suffocating in deep Japow are prime examples of
situations where having at least one partner would go a great way
towards preventing an embarrassing way to die. The high volcanoes here
in Kamchatka generally don't appear to exhibit such deep powder
(usually being very windswept), and there is a distinct lack of trees,
or for that matter, trees capable of producing tree-wells. On a
similar topic, the lines I was considering were not glaciated, so
falling into a crevasse was also a minimal possibility.

The author observed some solo travellers exhibiting overconfidence, a
lack of knowledge, and other psychological traps, making them more
susceptible to succumbing to an accident. They also observed that even
experienced and careful people travelling solo can be caught and
killed by a slide. These observations, while certainly important, need
to be placed in context with statistics and other considerations,
because, as most people who have done some avalanche education will be
aware, generally these factors could just as easily apply to groups as
they do to solo travellers. Groups also provide grounds for other risk
factors to arise (unhelpful group dynamics/personal interactions).

Obviously, and perhaps most importantly, travelling alone basically throws out
the possibility of rescue after burial in an avalanche. A beginner who is unable
to comprehend the risks, and makes a lower percentage of correct decisions in
the backcountry statistically relies much more on the experience of others and
the safety net provided by their partners in the form of companion rescue. I'm
aware that despite having taken some avalanche courses, I am still a relative
beginner and I am the perfect candidate for an avalanche victim, a confident
Male in my 20's, willing to take some risks, perhaps more than others.

Considering this further, how does the number of partners affect your chances of
being rescued in the event of a slide? If the slide path is large/long, and your
route makes it likely for multiple partners to be exposed during the ascent or
descent despite best management practices, will one or two partners be enough to
rescue you? What is the runout like? Are there cliffs below? Is the possibility
of avalanche unacceptable regardless of whether or not you have partners
available for rescue? These questions make me think more about the psychological
bias of "safety in numbers", and how it has applied to group trips I've been on
so far. During my recent course in New Zealand, I also learned that in order to
have a reasonable chance of surviving a long career, a professional working in
avalanche terrain needs to rely very much on making correct/cautious decisions
every time they go out (or choose not to go out), they cannot afford to play
Russian Roulette (pun kinda not intended!), no matter how good their partner's
rescue skills may be. In a guiding situation, I imagine that a client's rescue
skills could be fairly low anyway, and a potentially fatal avalanche involving a
client may reap even larger consequences for a guide than a personal accident
with friends.

On the 19th of February, with the weather continuing to look good in
all the forecasts, I hitched a ride with a snowmobile group from
[Kamchatka Freeride Community](https://www.allaboutkamchatka.ru/en/)
up to the Avachinsky base (870m), with a non-committal plan to explore
some of Koryaksky and Avachinsky. I was aware that there had been some
new snow a few days earlier, but wasn't sure how much had fallen, and
how much wind transport had occurred during the days following.

{{img(path="photos/alone-on-avachinsky/20200219_164341.jpg",
caption="One of the bases on Avachinsky, I stayed at this one on the second and third nights")}}

After a quick chat in broken Russian over some hot tea with an old
couple living in one of the bases about my desire to stay there for a
couple of nights later in the trip, I stepped out into bright sun and
skied up the valley towards the pass. A quick snow pit examination
during lunch revealed that there had been a fair bit of new snow, and
the possibility of wind slab was certainly something to be looking out
for. I stuck to the ridge line and made my way up the lower angle
slopes at the base of Koryaksky, I felt dwarfed by the peak above,
progress seemed impossibly slow despite the sun making tracks across
the sky. In the evening I was pretty well convinced that wind slab
would be a concern higher on the peak, so I selected a sheltered camp in
a hollow on the ridge at about 1600m. It was enthralling to be up high
with hardly a breath of wind and perfect visibility over the Pacific
Ocean and down to the southern end of the peninsula. I'm so glad there
was no wind because it was very cold, my stove refused to start (rated
to -20C), so I spent a good 30 minutes running up and down the hill
with it in my jacket before cooking dinner.

Being solo removes the the possibility of a partner initiating critical first
aid for an unconscious person and calling in or performing a rescue on behalf of
this person in the event of a serious mishap during a trip. This is perhaps an
unavoidable crux for the question of travelling solo, a risk you must accept
regardless of the trip planning/preparation. Originally a sceptic, I recently
bit the bullet and purchased an [InReach
Mini](https://explore.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/) after learning that a
[PLB](https://beacons.amsa.gov.au/about/beacon-types.asp#PLB) may not be legal
to use/carry in Russia due to its use of restricted radio frequencies. This
device is a great improvement on communication. I can enable tracking and have
someone at home watch my progress, and check on me. I feel that this does go a
little way towards the offsetting this risk on solo trips. In any event, a
serious accident is a situation that will likely require external rescue help,
as one or two partners will have a very difficult time performing an effective
rescue from a remote location. If there is a minor mishap, which can be solved
without a full-blown rescue, the improved communication of in InReach can also
be much more useful than a PLB. I guess it should go without saying, that it is
always important (whether solo or in a group), that someone external knows the
plan, and is able to call rescue and give accurate information if something goes
wrong.

Some other things I can think of which might help offset the risk of
mishap is to ensure you are adequately fit, and moving quickly and
efficiently, and don't push yourself beyond your limits, turn around
before becoming exhausted. Watch the weather, and conditions
carefully, try not to pick a day where it is working against you. Pick
objectives that are reasonable for your ability, and avoid the
temptation to be committed skiing a given line or summiting a given
peak. All the general precautions and risk management techniques that
apply to group trips, should be carefully applied to a solo adventure
where possible.

In the article [After avalanche deaths, experts renew call for
climbers to carry safety
gear](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/avalanche-safety-gear-1.5406387)
the author discusses the choice of many climbers to travel without an
avalanche beacon while in avalanche terrain in order to save weight,
and with the argument that if there is an avalanche they would likely
be killed anyway. It encourages people to consider wearing a beacon at
all times anyway in order to aid rescuers in the event of a body
recovery, and on the chance that a companion rescue may be possible if
the slide occurs on less serious terrain.

Rescuers put their lives at risk, and sacrifice their time to search
for missing people in these situations, and I guess as a solo
traveller, wearing a beacon, and tracking your location with an
InReach is the least you can do to make it safer and easier for a
rescue team to find your body, to help avoid yet more tragedy. Perhaps
the grim task of putting on a "useless" avalanche beacon in the
morning may serve as yet another reminder of one's own mortality, and
how important decisions during the trip will be.

I woke up, and unzipped the tent door to be welcomed by the sunrise
gleaming through the smoke of the fumaroles on the summit of
Avachinsky. It had been quite a cold night despite wearing all
clothes, and down jacket over the top, I regretted not taking
some extra insulation for under my legs. My hopes for an early start
were dashed when I retrieved a very frozen stove from the bottom of my
sleeping bag that took quite a long time to get started again. By the
time I had my tent packed it was pretty obvious I wasn't likely to be
making summit that day, almost another 2000m above.

As I continued up, ice, followed soft snow over exposed rocks on the
ridge required the removal of skis, and made progress incredibly
slow. It was getting to about lunch time again, at about 2150m I dug a
pit in the gully on the side and found yet more wind slab with a thick
layer of facets near the base this time. The decision to turn around
and save energy for an attempt on Avachinsky instead was easy.

There has been some research into how group size affects the
risk of involvement in avalanches: [Risk of Avalanche Involvement in
Winter Backcountry Recreation: The Advantage of Small Groups][1].

I found the following quotes from this research interesting:

> We found higher avalanche risk for groups of 4 or more people and
> lower risk for people traveling alone and in groups of 2. The
> relative risk of group size 4, 5, and 6 was higher compared with the
> reference group size of 2 in the Swiss and Italian dataset. The
> relative risk for people traveling alone was not significantly
> different compared with the reference group size of 2 in the Italian
> dataset but was lower in the Swiss dataset.

> Group decision-making is a highly complex topic and there is no
> empirical evidence whether groups make better decisions than

> The avalanche safety community should discuss how to advise

> decision-making may affect risk for solo travelers.

I've personally noticed that while travelling alone you have less distractions,
and you are more keenly aware of your own vulnerability. There is no-one to talk
to or take photos of, so you listen to the snow, and watch your environment
instead, constantly running the plan over in your head. This also makes it less
fun in some ways, sharing the experience with others is very enjoyable.

There always seems to be a compromise between the need for speed/efficiency
which equals safety in some respects and the need to stop and take stock of the
situation and possibly take a longer alternative route which offers safety in
other respects. I have been in situations where my partners have slowed us down
considerably (and I have also slowed my partners down at other times). I have
also been in situations where I felt the need to stop the group and argue that
we needed to take the time to look under the snow to double check our
assumptions about the conditions. It's an awful feeling when you compromise on
your own values and sway with the group, everyone is aware that even just having
the argument wastes precious time.

There seems to be some benefits to travelling alone, but it's also clear that it
introduces some extra risk over travelling in an experienced and sensible group
of 3 or 4, who you can bounce ideas off and collaborate with effectively. I feel
like the most important thing is to always try to be aware of the actual risks
involved, and the actual benefits that having partners, rescue equipment, etc,
provides in your given scenario, and to constantly adjust plans and expectations
to ensure that you stay within your personal risk appetite/plan.

When I reached the Avachinsky base in the early afternoon I was
directed over to one of the other bases, it was empty, being managed
by a friendly man named Ivan. I found a way to charge my devices using
the USB slot on the TV before the power cut, and had a comfortable and
warm night before waking up early to yet another perfect morning to
make tracks up Avachinsky before sunrise.

I chose a route which stuck to the ridge line, free of exposure to
slides, covered in sastrugi, and swept by an increasing wind. Near the
top of the ridge the lack of snow once again necessitated the removal
of skis, and several steps across volcanic soil before reaching a
saddle/plateau. Here the wind was absolutely whipping and I kept
moving to stay warm.

The final slope up to the summit of Avachinsky is definitely steep
enough to slide, however it quickly became clear that most of the snow
had been removed by the wind, and crampons were necessary for the
final 700m vertical meters of altitude. The slope seemed endless and I
was close to exceeding my turn-around time when the huge plumes of
smoke came into view once again and I stepped up onto the rim of the
crater, plunging steps through a thin layer of ice over warm and muddy
soil. It was an incredible feeling being up there, face covered in ice
and the view over to the impressive Koryaksky is unmatched. I didn't
stop for long, after downing a Snickers bar I scratched my way down
the ice crust and was able to ski almost from the summit, making use
of a small wind drift behind a small line feature which drapes itself
over that side of the volcano. Once gaining the plateau, I opened up
the throttle until reaching a choke point where the slope steepens
once again.

{{img(path="photos/alone-on-avachinsky/20200220_144802.jpg",
caption="Fumaroles on Avachinsky")}}

It was a decision point, I committed to a line, but stopped above the
final steep slope to dig a pit, there was some wind/storm slab here of
concern with a steep roll-over terrain feature below me. I was about
to climb back up again the way I had come to retrace my morning route,
when a little exploration to the left yielded a way which avoided
almost all of the exposure, and I cruised on down back to the base, a
perfect day to cap off an amazing trip.

The following morning I skied my way out to the road pleasantly
surprised to be greeted by my Anna's friend Anna (who is on the
Russian ski mountaineering team) with a 4WD to pick me up not long
after she had just arrived home from a competition trip abroad.

A couple of weeks later I was able to join forces with Alexei to climb
and ski Kozelsky, making it a skyline trifecta. Koryaksky summit can
wait for another day, I'm pretty well convinced it will be even more
fun in warmer conditions!

On a side note I created this video recently about the season in Kamchatka:

{{ youtube(id="RxpoXRpjs8o",class="youtube") }}

I'm currently living in Gudauri, Georgia with Anna, having just made it into the
country before the borders closed due to COVID-19, and my Russian visa would
have expired soon thereafter. Hoping to write more soon about the season in
Kamchatka, and our last minute dash to Georgia!
