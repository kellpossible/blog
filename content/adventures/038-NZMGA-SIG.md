4 lockers pear
4 non lockers
1 120cm sling
1 240cm sling ( I will take cordallete)
2 ice screws and v threaded
2 prussiks 

Wire for repair kit
Leatherman

Water bottle where?

Automatic crampons for the ski guide exam. Semi auto crampons toe piece rivet is worn out by the ski boot tech inserts.
Need more ergonomic hammer, unlikely to even  take hammer on ski guide exam
Don't need autoblock belay if I'm not going to use it.

240cm sling packs smaller than cordallete, cordallete can be cut for anchor.

No leash for ice axe is fine, just take care where and how you put it down when at the anchor or stopped
Most clients no leash, maybe if they are a bit of a clutz

1.5-2 x the amount of precipitation in MCV for the precipitation on the divide.

Practice with mechanical ascender and with only prussiks. Remember foot prusik goes under the waist prussik when using both. Foot goes above waist when using mechanical

Practice passing a knot up and down.

Improvised harnesses. Bring some tape for this.

Self rescue use prussiks, because it's easier to get past the knots in the rope.

For skiing with clients. Put client on end of rope keep the rest in my bag,  it's faster and they don't know how to do a rescue anyway, they can only hold fall.

If you have a pulley (not microtraction) where is the best place to put it, on the victim or on the rope?

Short roping round coils in hand hold their shape better than lap / back and forth coils
Slip knot for hand hold is good for changing modes quickly

Troy Avalanche Presentation 
Morning meeting with clients about avalanche hazard. Talking through. Involving the clients in this makes them more interested to dig a pit.

Call guides when there is bad weather they are more likely to be free for call. 

Communicating with senior guide can be important. Communication tools can be important for this.

Avalanche terrain with persistent slab, one test is not enough to determine if it is safe, especially in considerable danger. It can propagate above or below you. Cana be dangerous to approach from below even just to dig a pit in the run-out. 

Recommend committing to a company well organised with supervising guide.

Being based in one area can be good to build up skills being familiar and not always having to deal with new terrain. Mind familiarity trap of course.

Mindset is about making sure everyone is on the same page but don't spend 15 minutes talking about it.

Good webcams are very useful.

Most accidents with clients occur when the guide is driven by their own ambitions.

Pre dinner snacks and dessert is good.

Sushi.

Practice cooking meals beforehand.

Terrain Crampons.
Pay close attention to the client comfort and footwork. Always err on the side of caution with crampons if there is any kind of ice and exposure, even if it is something I feel comfortable on, it may make the client feel uncomfortable and to have an accident there would be considered stupid with no crampons. Same goes for myself while guiding clients, add an extra layer of caution. Resist the urge to be lazy with crampon transitions. 

Crevasse rescue
When approaching the lip from above with a prussi, tie off a bite of rope before stepping on the edge.
Can ask client to help by pulling the rope travelling towards them.
May not require 6 to 1 if client is helping. 
Pay careful attention to preparing the lip and making the client exit easy.
Can place the padding ice axe on a sling prussik attached to the rope of the fallen climber where it emerges on the surface.
Mixing dry snow with wet snow can help to make concrete.

Navigation
Compass bearings can be very useful to take before visibility drops.

Pay careful attention to the position of the clients with respect to the slope angle.

Making lunch at the hut saves time in the field important for a guide. Mostly horizontal Ridge pitches can have the guide lead first.

Short rope
Stay above the clients, have them slightly behind while going uphill traverse and slightly in front while going downhill traverse. 2 client short rope, have weaker client on shorter length. Shorter client stays on uphill side of the other client's rope.

Escaping the belay 
Especially with small carbiners make sure the munter is loaded in the correct orientation before tying it off. You can pull it tight using the middle loop like with a clove hitch.

Important to practice improvised harness and chest harness.

Jamie usually carries 4 22cm screws in the party. Ice bulges usually make the anchor weaker. Get rid of them.

Ice climbing
Loosen lower tool before pulling on the upper tool and stepping up. 

Crevasse rescue
Vectoring when client gets close to the lip. Pulling up on the rope about 1m from the lip.

Getting good at making snow caves. Quick to make an L shaped cave and get clients in, then build into a T.
Definitely practice a trench with tarp if you will use it. Find out the parameters of the test, am I allowed to walk to find a wind drift?

Knowing the names of plants, animals, details about glaciers, glaciology. Climbing and ski guiding history. A walk through the DOC museum is good for this.

Improvised sleds. Rescue tarp? Mat inside rescue tarp. System that is made of skis? If you do it with your skis it might not work because you need your skis to pull client out. Definitely have this sorted. Is there a rescue bothy? Ask Evan to make one for me?

Navigation
Set up the new zealand grid references.

Altimeter in the watch can be very useful for navigating contouring.

Get used to making a navigation plan. Grid references, bearings.

Knots in sling or prussik for counting rope lengths.

From bottom of slope head 271 degrees for 
3.8km to point 1871

Skinnies sunblock only need to use a small amount and it works really well. Can buy at pharmacy.
