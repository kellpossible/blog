Why do the best adventures always seem to happen when I break my phone? I
was contemplating this while sitting by the round-about in Mansfield
outside the pub, waiting for my friends to arrive.

I had managed to break my phone that day while on a day trip to Mt
Stirling with MUMC and MUSKI, and now the prospect of heading to the
West Ridge of Mt Buller without a phone was increasingly exciting. My
previous trip without a phone (see earlier article "When Climbers Go
Sailing") was a raging success.

An early start the next morning, and we raced up the hill to try and get
to the ice, which according to [Chockstone, Mt Buller Ice
Climbing](http://www.chockstone.org/MtBulla/MtBulla.htm) could be
present if we looked in the right place. When we finally did reach the
spot, and downclimbed to the ice, it was a little disapointing. A group
behind us was planning to spend the day climbing there too. With a
bluebird day, the choice was easy, we spent the day skiing around
instead.
