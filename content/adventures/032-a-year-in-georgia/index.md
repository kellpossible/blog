In March 2020, my 3 months in Kamchatka was coming to an end, unable
to extend my Russian visa, we opted for plan B, living for some time
in Georgia, as both Anya and I could stay there for up to a year. With
a heartwarming send-off from our Kamchatka friends, we loaded our
clothes and skis into a plane in Yelisova airport, and flew 8 hours to
Moscow.

I had been watching the global pandemic unfold with one eye on the
news, hoping that we would not be too late to enter
Georgia. Unfortunately we had a number of important errands to run in
Moscow which could not be skipped. One morning, about 5 days into our
stay in Moscow, our friend Taylor (who lives in Georgia), gave us the
notice that the borders would be closing in 2 days. This was before
our flight was scheduled!

We frantically rushed around the city visiting translators, collecting
documents, all the while I took my laptop out in the taxi and
attempted to book new tickets and to cancel our previous tickets on an
airline website which was undergoing a DOS from panicking
customers. This was probably the most stressful day of my life. In the
end we completed all tasks, and were sitting in a Moscow traffic jam
with the clock counting down for our flight. The map revealed that the
express train for the airport was not far, and we quickly changed
course, and rushed with skis, bags and all into the train station and
purchased a ticket for the next train. We bustled through the terminal
with the train pulling onto the platform one minute later. We later
calculated that if we had missed that train we would have missed our
flight, and probably our chance to go to Georgia, and thus I may have
needed to return back to Australia seperated from Anya. We are
constantly thankful to Taylor for pressing us to go early!

Our flight to Georgia was via Turkey, it required a change of
airlines, and a re-check-in of our bags. The Turkish border control
the officials were rather relaxed at the late hour, amusingly they
seemed more interested in their phones than potential COVID laden
passengers entering their country, but we couldn't complain, the
airport lounge was very comfortable. Upon arrival in a snow covered
Tbilisi, we were greeted by people in white suits performing thermal
scans, thankfully we passed, and we quickly scrambled our way to
Gudauri.
