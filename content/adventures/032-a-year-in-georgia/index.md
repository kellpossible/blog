In March 2020, my 3 months in Kamchatka was coming to an end, unable
to extend my Russian visa, we opted for plan B, living for some time
in Georgia, as both Anya and I could stay there for up to a year. With
a heartwarming send-off at the airport from our Kamchatka friends, we
loaded our clothes and skis into a plane in Yelisova airport, and flew
8 hours to Moscow.

I had been watching the global pandemic unfold with one eye on the
news, hoping that we would not be too late to enter
Georgia. Unfortunately we had a number of important errands to run in
Moscow which could not be skipped. One morning, about 5 days into our
stay in Moscow, our friend Taylor (who lives in Georgia), gave us the
notice that the borders would be closing in 2 days. This was before
our flight was scheduled!

We frantically rushed around the city visiting translators, collecting
documents, all the while I took my laptop out in the taxi and
attempted to book new tickets and to cancel our previous tickets on an
airline website which was struggling with all the panicking
customers. This was probably the most stressful day of my life. In the
end we completed all tasks, and were sitting in a Moscow traffic jam
with the clock counting down for our flight. The map revealed that the
express train for the airport was not far, and we quickly changed
course, and rushed with skis, bags and all into the train station and
purchased a ticket for the next train. We bustled through the terminal
with the train pulling onto the platform one minute later. We later
calculated that if we had missed that train we would have missed our
flight, and probably our chance to go to Georgia. We are constantly
thankful to Taylor for pressing us to go early!

Our flight to Georgia was via Turkey, it required a change of
airlines, and a re-check-in of our bags. The Turkish border control
the officials were rather relaxed at the late hour, amusingly they
seemed more interested in their phones than potential COVID laden
passengers entering their country, but we couldn't complain, the
airport lounge was very comfortable. Upon arrival in a snow covered
Tbilisi, we were greeted by people in white suits performing thermal
scans, thankfully we passed, and we quickly scrambled our way to
Gudauri.

## Quarantine in Gudauri

For the first few days in Gudauri we stayed in a small guest
house. Some guests from Japan and some guests from Urkraine were
staying with us, but we got the impression that with the resort being
closed, any remaining tourists would be leaving soon, and all guest
houses would be closing. 

We visited Taylor and met with his Vagabond ski instructor crew, most
of whom had decided to stay put in Gudauri for a Spring of ski
touring! Anya and I found an apartment in the same block with them,
and we moved in to the community of ski bums suriviving the
apocolypse, ski touring during the day and celebrating in the
evenings. One evening our Georgian friends Sopo and Kato taught us how
to make Khinkali, and another evening we celebrated half-year American
Thanksgiving. Among us were people from Georgia, America, Italy,
Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, Russia and Australia.

Unfortunately the bed in our apartment was extremely saggy and we were
sleeping on the floor, but with all the tourists leaving we managed to
find a good deal with an apartment in New Gudauri We spent a day
shuttling our luggage in backpacks up the hill on skis.

In New Gudauri, a litter of about 8, extremely fluffy puppies
appeared, and became the entertainment of the children wandering
between empty ski town streets, we often stopped to cuddle. Someone
built them a shelter, but an army of security guards marched past our
window to remove it!

While walking up the hill for a day of skiing we met Alex, an excited
Frenchman towing his snowboard up the hill on a rope, who had remained
in Gudauri with his partner Lena from Russia. We later spent several
fun evenings trying Georgian wine with them before sneaking back home
to our apartment after curfew.

## A Wedding in Gomi

The Vagabond group decided to leave Guduari to live on a property in
the tiny town of Gomi, in the Guria region, near Ozergheti. They would
be helping a friend Lika to build a campsite called Dumbo Eco
Camp. After a short stay in Tbilisi we joined them, sleeping in our
small tent under the hazlenut groves next to the river. It's warm and
humid in Guria, with a thunderstorm being a common occurance in the
evenings during Summer. I loved walking in barefoot on the grass, and
swimming in the cold river.

A local, Lasha invited us over for a lavish Georgian supra a number of
times. We watched the ducks swimming around in his ponds, and the
chickens being bred nearby. He peppered us with gifts in what probably
turned out to be an attempt to find some people to run his new guest
house. We were all rather intrigued by his purpose, and he gifted us a
number of antique sewing machines! We visited the honey guy, who
appeared very comical, and very drunk. We caught some dogs rummaging
around our trash and breaking into the compost bin, one of whom was
the beatiful, and crazy Bobic, who we all came to love and hate, a
major character.

Some of our friends began to make plans to leave Georgia and return to
Europe. Anya and I had organised to be married in Moscow, however due
to the unravelling COVID situation it became clear that we could not
follow that plan. Sitting at the table with all our friends, we
decided that we could just make a wedding in 3 days, Lika was a
wedding planner after all and she declared it was possible! Before we
knew what was happening we had booked for our marriage at the service
hall, and planned an informal ceremony to take place on top of the
nearby Gomi mountain. We invited our family and friends to join us on
a Zoom video call, someone said they had an internet connection on the
mountain, but we had no time to test the theory!
