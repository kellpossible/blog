# Blog - [lukefrisken.com](http://lukefrisken.com)

This is the personal blog for me (Luke Frisken). Content is written in CommonMark Markdown and the website is generated using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). Photo captions were create/edited using the [photo-captioner](https://github.com/kellpossible/photo-captioner)
tool which was created for this purpose.

Photos are rotated according to their exif data using [exiftran](https://linux.die.net/man/1/exiftran)

```sh
exiftran -a -i *.jpg
```
